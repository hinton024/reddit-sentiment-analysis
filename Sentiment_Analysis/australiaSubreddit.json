He's in a VE V6 Ute and figures, \"Hey, I'm in the middle of nowhere, no one is around, I'll see how fast my ute can go.\" He speeding towards 140, when he hears a voice come up on the radio. \"Would the person in the white ute please slow down.\" He quickly looks around, wondering who is watching him and how. Eventually, he realises there's a plane above his vehicle, tracking his speed.\n\n- This happened to me and my wife about two years ago. I was driving the vehicle and noticed a police car in the distance. As the car comes closer towards us, the police car flashes their lights. I figured I must've been speeding, so I pull over. Usual procedure, police officer approaches the driver's side and asks for my license, which I hand over. He then asks, \"Sir, who is the owner of this vehicle?\" To which I replied, \"Oh, that would be my wife\". To which he replies, \"Oh okay, our vehicle detected that the sex of the driver didn't match the sex of the owner of the vehicle.\" While I was thankful that I wasn't pulled over for speeding, I was a bit shocked that a police had that capability and was able to perform this detection in about 30 seconds.\n\nWatch Francis Ford Coppala's \"The Conversation\".

As it is so cheap. Perhaps not even with the child's knowledge (teenagers are funny like that).

The longitudinal studies have strong correlations with increased risk of severe and potentially debilitating mental health issues.

I\u2019m originally Colombian but have lived in Australia for over 8 years so as you must know already I get excited with football easy. \n\nMy partner is from also overseas background, Chinese and till we started dating together she was hopeless about football. Over time she has learned but in this World Cup she is on fire! Her passion for the game has grown and her admiration for the players is genuine.\n\nOn the first Match of Colombia VS Korea, there was some face painting kiosks from FIFA for the fans and she decided to get the Colombia colours painted. While doing the queue we meet an Australia couple with a young girl and after having a good chat I was excited and really happy to hear that they were there so the little girl can learn, feel and see women Football. \n\nOn the match against Germany, I was surrounded by Colombian fans cheering for Las Cafeteras. But next to me was an Australian mom with her son. They came to the match just to enjoy the event and have fun. Short after she was asking me question about the team and the fans in general because she and her son were hyped by the vibe that was building. Even after a couple of minutes I was saw the little kid trying to repeat the cheers in Spanish and clapping like crazy. I was happy seeing how he became on Colombian fan on the spot (sorry Germany). He was cheering for Caicedo and when she jumped like a full fan when she made the goal. But the best part was when Colombia did the second on the extra time, me and all the Colombian fan where high fiving the mom and the kid because they celebrated the goal with the same passion that any Colombian did.\n\nAnd looking around in both matches I found a lot of similar situations. for me that is a peak moment and why this World Cup is huge for Australia. because those kids and their families are going to remember this World cup and will have a complete different look to Women in sports and specially in Football.

Not many of them actually played soccer. But they all had their ideas about their skills versus ours. \n\nI was an middling below average B/C grade player in University. Our boyfriends would sit on the sidelines saying we were 'slow' and 'boring' and that they would run laps round us. Typical 'womens sport sucks compared to men's' comments. \n\nOne day, after we'd won by 6 goals, my coach overheard them. He'd had enough. So next training session we had a fun boys vs girls match. All grades took part. Long story short. We won. Soccer is way more technical than what they were used to. And our fitness wasn't any better or worse. Some of them were faster. Some of them were stronger. But overall, they weren't 'better'.  The A grade team smashed their boys. Even F grade won by one goal.  Fair enough it wasn't men's soccer players vs womens soccer players but it shut them up. For a while. \n\nSo, all these boys sitting there in the pub.

You don't really need to crunch the numbers to know this though, just look around the normal populace, you will find a lot more fans of AFL and NRL compared to cricket.\n\nThe reason revenue wise Australia earns so much from cricket is afaik, there is a huge revenue pool that gets shared primarily among only 10 full member teams, and Aus is part of the big 3 of the 10 ( Other 2 are England and India). \n\nSo it isn't necessarily an indicator of popularity in viewership numbers, which is TV ratings are mostly about. \n\nBtw, before someone else starts scowling that I am downplaying Australia's role in cricket, just want to clarify that I am only talking about popularity in terms of viewership numbers here, not the quality.

For the most part, it is no more or less advanced than any other way to play (aside from crude route 1 or something).  A sides style of play comes from a number of factors (the resources at hand, the managers inclination/experience, the way the other team plays etc.)    \n\nThere\u2019s just so much more to it than you seem to grasp\u2026.  Everything you\u2019ve said is wrong (if you think the Matildas hold their shape better than the Roos you are blind!  Their midfield is consistently out of shape, and they are terrible at being in the right place to get on the end of dangerous balls, follow things in etc.  So many of their goals come from troddling it in from terrible defensive errors, there\u2019s heaps of sketchy decision making, they\u2019re slow making triangles for options/support if it happens at all, so much of it is long balls to lost possession because the ladies have trouble bringing it down, I could go on\u2026).  \n\nYou even contradict yourself.  I mean, which is it anyway, one moment you have them playing a possession style game, the next on the counter?  It can\u2019t be both.  (Australia dominated possession in their first 2 matches)  \n\nI mean fark, if they are strategically superior then why isn\u2019t Tony Gustavsson in line for the Roos job?  Why don\u2019t managers move between the top mens and womens NT\u2019s/club sides?\n\nIf you like I can go into a lot of specific details here about how messy the Matildas are in comparison to the Roos (anyone who knows the game could).  I\u2019d rather not though, because it comes across as crass and rude, and will only end in more culture warring.  I\u2019d rather just support the Matildas (like I have for decades) and see them do well, see the game grow and flourish, which it won\u2019t do if everyone keeps turning it into the battle of the sexes.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s ok if you personally prefer womens football.  The fact that it\u2019s a lot simpler and played at a slower pace probably even helps for the casual viewers who are less familiar with the sport.  I know that\u2019s the case for me when I watch womens AFL (given my inexperience with the sport, and my trouble understanding it, I find the ladies game much easier to follow).  If that\u2019s what you enjoy more, then great!

And I did Welfare Economics so this type of Macro Econ wasn't exactly my strength.\n\nMy answer is unfettered corporate greed in the name of supply chain inflation.\n\nWe are in almost 'Stagflation', which was seen during the oil shocks in the 70s, where the Inflation is high, economic growth is slow and unemployment is high. However, this is caused by an external shock, such as the oil crisis. Economists expected to see an example of this with the supply chain shocks caused by Covid. However, the supply chain issues have largely (and not to say all) worked themselves out. We are currently in a new type of economic cycle we have never seen before, with high inflation that is seemingly uncorrelated to the low unemployment, with mediocre economic growth. Usually the Economic Model  of the Phillips Curve shows there is a correlation between unemployment and wages - in a tight job market, wages should be rising. This is not happening. This is because in the Marginal Product of Labor and Capital, (K) being capital is assuming all the gains in productivity in the Q = f(L, K) function.\n\nWhat we are seeing is Corporates masquerading jacking up prices as supply chain inflation. There has certainly been some supply chain inflation, but the record profits recorded by the Corporates in this time shows that there is certainly some misguidance on their part in regards to this.\n\nUnfortunately, our Corporate Watchdog in Australia, and their counterparts in the rest of the West, have been weakened by Corporate lobbying, and duopolies like Wooloworth / Coles, QANTAS / Virgin, BHP / Rio (to a lesser extent), etc, have been allowed to consolidate power.\n\nThis means where there is supply chain collusion like there is with the duo/oligopolies , there is no competition to drive downwards force on the price. To simplify it - think of your towns paper back in the 90s - 2000s, they had perfect competition. For my hometown of Brisbane, if someone sold the Courier Mail for over $2, you'd tell them to fuck off, and go to the next shop, and buy it for $2. When Colesworth can effectively collude to price-fix on goods, you have no alternatives, except for Aldi, and maybe a IGA, who are MetCash who are fucked and offer no real resistance to the big two, as Colesworth have driven your local grocerers, butchers, etc to the wall.\n\nThere will be no end to the Corporate Greed I can see without government intervention - either putting caps on goods (which I doubt they have political will  to do given who their doners are), the ACCC grows some balls and breaks up some of these Oligopolies or the rich are dragged out onto the street and shown why the French Revolution put these type of wealth-extracting policies on hold for 224 years.\n\nEdit - I realise I actually didn't answer your question - the profits are being turned into Executive bonuses, and more returns to shareholders, or those that hold Equity (aka stocks) in the companies engaged in the corporate marauding."}, {"author": "Headkix", "created": 1691138314.0, "text": "It's the reverse of the tale of Robin Hood, plain and simple, the rich are taking from the poor, but, picture the modern Robin Hood as the CEO's, CFO's, Owners,  of these greedy corporations/businesses these people (if you can call them that) don't put money back into the economy, they just hoard it in a \"I'm richer than you dick measuring\" contest, and because our pollies are in their back pocket things won't change, sorry to say, but this is the reality!"}, {"author": "512165381", "created": 1691141706.0, "text": "So we have house and stocks rising at 7% compound, and wages rise 3% compound.

Welcome to adulthood.  \nNow before you get mad, let me explain.  I only mean that as *\"Congrats on living to an age where you are starting to see the same patterns your parents told you about, but you laughed them off as old folks who don't really understand today's world.*\"  Now you're starting to become aware of what they knew from decades of living.\n\nWarning: Lots to unpack coming up because you asked a big question with a lot of different stuff at play. Its not a small answer.  The world, life, gov't, they are all much bigger systems than your question would imply from the simple *\"If the beer is more why aren't the wages?\"*\n\nDisclaimer: This is marked as an apolitical topic.  But you can't talk about global finances without at least mentioning that gov'ts are in control of billions and billions of dollars in spending.  Please recognize that this post mentions nations for their financial involvement in a global economy but is not talking about the politics *of* those nations.  Just about the money they move.\n\nAt 20 everyone loves the idea of social services like free everything for everyone.  And we vote into power people in favor of free college, free food, free mobile phones, free internet, help the poor of every 3rd world nation, 30 weeks of paid time off paid by the gov't... take in 8 million refugees every year and set them up with food and a place to live and schooling and stipend until they get work. Send billions to whichever nation is being ravaged by war this year.  Its all great and we don't want to make hard choices about who gets what: Everyone gets everything.\n\nBy 30 you've been a voting age adult for long enough to start seeing patterns.  You can't really know how your vote matters until you've seen the result of it 10 times - and that takes years.  So that's just starting to take hold by virtue of living long enough.  You still have your ideals.  You still think free university for all is a good thing, but now you're wondering *\"If the university is free, how does the professor get paid and the campus get maintained?\"*\n\nAt 40 you've had your home, seen your property taxes go up and not get more services for that. You're paying more but that pothole is still there and your tap water tastes horrible.  You've put your parents in a care-facility that used to be paid for by the gov't and now is costing your entire second job's wages. You hear about a new tax to pay for something in the education system and you don't even have kids. You start to realize that all that \"free\" stuff has to get paid for somewhere.  The bigger picture is creeping into your head.\n\nBy 50 another big reality hits you.  Its all one big Ponzi scheme. Or Pyramid scheme if you know that term instead.  I mean life.  Earth is a closed system.  Its not like money is being injected into our economy from the Martians. So when you get rich it means you took that money out of someone else's pocket.  Had to.  It didn't come from thin air.  Money only moves from place to place. If you give a billion to a country to help them out after a typhoon, it means **it left your country**.  Its gone.  But you still want all the social services and infrastructure that your gov't is supposed to provide, right?  Again, how does that get paid for?\n\nWhen I was a kid the population was under 4billion.  Now its approaching 8billion with a massive number of them being in 3rd world nations.  So where is the money coming from to feed house and clothe those billions if they are in countries that have nearly no exports, no products or services to sell to the 1st world countries?  Financial assistance.  A current living example of this is the take over of Niger by its military and first thing everyone is afraid for is that all the financial aide from other countries is going to get cut off during the uprising.  In other words, this country survives on welfare handouts from prosperous countries.  From your taxes.\n\nYou see the same in America.  18,000 people monthly pour in from their Southern border trying to escape the poor conditions, drug cartel violence etc. etc.  And we all want to help these people: Of course we do.  We feel bad for them.  But, 18,000 monthly?  That's an entire city. Per month.  Every month of the year.\n\nAgain, where does that money come from?  If you double the population of the planet in my lifetime, and the wealthy countries prop up the destitute countries - one way or another either by aide, or by taking in half their population annually,  who's paying for that and how?  The gov'ts are paying for it, and governments have only one source of income: Their population.\n\nThe other thing about this doubling of the population is the logistics of making everything.  Food land shrinking because they all want houses.  Same with timber land.  Everyone wants 50 pair of jeans in their lifetime and that takes cotton, dye and processing.  That takes land.  And there isn't more land to take.  So the price of land goes up as it becomes an ever diminishing commodity.  And that cost becomes part of the cost of products, but not an increase to your wages.\n\nThen you have improved medical science.  All those people from my generation are going to live longer than our parents did just like you'll live longer than your parents did.  So I'm going to draw out of social programs longer than planned.  And that's not a savings account just sitting there.  Those programs are paid for by tax income drawn on the working age people: That's how those systems work.  But that same middle age tier is also busy making kids, that's how the population is still growing, so they're getting squeezed from both sides to pay for the old and the young.\n\nSo when you ask: *\"Where is all this money going with the rising cost of living if its not back into payroll?\"* \\- Its going to 200 different small and large effects of uncontrolled population expansion.\n\nHow do we fix it?  I know that's going to be your retort.  Hey I don't know-I'm not in that line of work.  But I can point out something that would help.  As a people we have to give up this Utopian idea that everyone gets everything equal-equal whether you work hard or not.  And we have to quit being so pissy with the politicians that make the hard calls for the betterment of all.  Recently we just lost hosting some big sport competition world games thingie or another.  And the news is filled with people talking about how embarrassing that is etc.  I don't see anyone giving credit to the guy that had enough back-bone to say *\"I'm not going to bankrupt the state with 7 billion in rising costs.\"*   Be sad about it all you want, but give the guy credit for wanting to put that money into programs that will better serve us.  We need more people willing to take that heat, not less.

Now I know a bunch of people are going to get more than a little worked up reading this and push that downvote button faster than Scomo evacuated his bowls at Engadine Maccas but I will say it anyway because I believe people should know the truth.\n\nThat truth is that for the last three decades (since the last \"recession we had to have\" in the 90's) the vast majority of economic growth has been funded by injecting ever more money to the system via housing loans. Labor started it in the 90's as a way of escaping the recession and kick starting the economy again. Howard took that idea and turbo charged it to shift the entire bloody economy to revolve around it rather than rolling it back when times were \"good\".\n\nThis post is going to be long enough already, but people need to know that it was not always like this. Back before the 90's/00's, housing was still expensive but not \"for the rest of your working life\" expensive. Many could work hard and pay off their home by 40, allowing them to take out another loan against their home to start a business or simply direct income to living a better life. Businesses too used to have far more debt, in order to start and run a business people would often have to borrow for several years before turning a profit and banks balance sheets used to be 2/3 business debt and 1/3 household debt. That changed in the 90's and we shifted much of that debt burden on to households who then serviced the debt and passed the money generated to business so they had less debt.\n\nWhat this means is that without the growth created by housing loans being ever larger many people would have slightly worse, slightly lower paying jobs, unemployment would be a bit higher and things overall would be just a little worse for everyone except we would all be able to afford homes that cost on average 3-4x household income or $350k. \n\nThe problem we have now is that the proverbial can has been kicked down the road so many times that it is now turned in to a huge multi Trillion (Current mortgage debt is in excess of $2 Trillion) dollar cluster fuck sitting on the balance sheets of Australians households. Very few can afford to start a new business or build real wealth outside of their home because our debt burdens are so high that it takes our entire working lives to service the loans leading to massive stagnation in our economy. \n\nTo correct housing costs would require that we end this cycle and allow housing to correct to sustainable levels matching household incomes. But household incomes would take a massive tumble at the same time because our economy is rotten to the core with so many zombie businesses that exist simply because of the excess money housing loans have been injecting to the economy. Even productive businesses would see their income fall and be required to cut back on staff and production. However that is exactly what we need to end this inflation cycle, but inflation is the only thing keeping that massive debt bomb aka. household mortgages under control. \n\nFinally, and this really will get people to hit the downvote button because most fail to be able to understand this concept. **We do not have a housing shortage in this country**. What we have is a **massive allocation issue and a shortage of affordable housing**. There is a difference between the two. We are one of the world leaders in both square meters of housing by population and number of rooms per person in the world when it comes to housing. Does that sound like a shortage to you? The answer to this whole mess is not **just** \"build more houses\", but to allow our existing stock to be priced realistically. This will force many people who are sitting in huge 3+ bed homes as a single/couple to re-evaluate holding on to that home while it loses value and consider downsizing to a more appropriate home freeing up stock for younger growing families. Perhaps even a shift back to having extended family units (parents living with children in to retirement, as is common in so many other parts of the world) living under one roof.\n\nThe cost of all this of course is going to be horrific, an entire generation will be all but financially bankrupted after committing to lifelong loans on something worth half what they will pay or less. People will lose their jobs and homes. Everyone will feel a hell of a lot poorer for a while. But on the upside, homes will be affordable, and our economy will be free to grow again. The recovery phase will see a huge rebalance of wealth and many younger people will actually be able to make a life, start businesses and compete with the existing monopolies that have grown fat and wasteful over the last three decades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, what do you think? Should we try let inflation run and keep housing prices elevated in the hope that it becomes our children's problem to deal with just like we have for the last 30 years? Or are we going to accept that now is the time to end the Ponzi scheme and try fix the fundamental issues with our economic model in this country? Personally both options scare the hell out of me and I dislike them both, but no one out there has a realistic third option and many people a hell of a lot smarter than me have tried to find one."}, {"author": "dark_elf_2001", "created": 1691120071.0, "text": "So now that housing organisations support rent caps as well as the HAFF, that'll mean everyone'll support both yeah?"}, {"author": "22Starter22", "created": 1691104315.0, "text": "Real estate agents are assessing you based on how you look these days.

They are losing primary votes to minors and independents. That's right, they would prefer to DESTROY democracy than ADAPT to the changing voter needs. AEC came along, and said DISQUALIFIED, DISQUALIFIED (deregistered) to my micro party after one of these reforms. All those years of work for hundreds of volunteers and many dollars wasted. If you are a member of the Greens, Sustainable Australia or One Nation or even independents, mark my words, THE MAJORS WILL GO AFTER YOUR PARTY NEXT until it's just two parties that dominate the government.\n\nI think this just proves it wasn't the fault of voters for being greedy, anti-poor, pro-USA, etc, it's the major parties in the past exploited their voter momentum to pass laws to enrich them in the form of benefits, cushy jobs, etc. That makes them the most BANAL EVIL political parties we can have in government.

The provisions of those bills will benefit and help shore up the flailing support for those two big parties.\n\n> I'm going to make some detailed comments on each of the bills, but I first want to start with the disgusting process that these bills have followed. They only just passed the House yesterday, and here they are. They were exempted from the cut-off, which normally would give private members' bills, or any bill, the appropriate time for scrutiny, deliberation, consideration, amendment and discussion. They were exempted from the cut-off order yesterday, such that in less than 24 hours these bills will now be rammed through both houses of parliament. That's not democracy and it's certainly not integrity or transparency. One has to think that an election is in the offing when the two big parties are ganging up to try to make sure that voters have fewer choices on who to vote for. They're ramming through these three bills in order to achieve that. The process of these bills passing the parliament is an example of how not to do democracy and really proves the point of why we need to break the back of the two-party system, so that we have a democracy that's functioning in the interests of the public rather than just a little power play thing for the two big parties.\n\nMore at: https://www.openaustralia.org.au/senate/?id=2021-08-26.6.1"}, {"author": "SYD-LIS", "created": 1691102975.0, "text": "\u261d\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4c"}, {"author": "ive_got_weak_acid", "created": 1691121219.0, "text": "Hi uw888, I'm interested.

LETS TACKLE YOUR IMMIGRATION STANCE :)** The main cause of the unaffordable housing crisis is not just immigration, but a combination of factors. The pdf I shared highlights various reasons contributing to the problem, including restrictive zoning laws, slow construction rates (look how long so much shit takes to build now-a-days because of dodgy contractors that need reform), and speculative investment driving up prices. Yes, implementing public housing has historically helped bring down costs by increasing supply and providing affordable, stable options aka competition!\n\nRestricting immigration may provide some short-term relief, but it won't address the long-term issue of housing unaffordability, especially with Australia's growing population. Skilled migrants contribute to the economy, fill labor shortages, and support our aging population. We need a comprehensive approach that includes increasing housing supply, improving construction efficiency, and curbing speculative investment.\n\nDenying immigration might seem like a quick fix, but it won't solve the underlying problems. We must acknowledge the need for smart policies that encourage affordable housing while still maintaining the benefits of immigration. By taking a holistic approach, we can create a sustainable and equitable housing market for all Australians. It's essential to consider both short-term and long-term solutions, working together to strike a balance between managing population growth and ensuring a prosperous and inclusive society for the future.\n\n**WHY? LETS TACKLE YOUR RESOURCE AND LABOUR STANCE :)** You're absolutely right, and it's crucial to address the actual problem of severe shortage of workers in the construction industry in Australia. This shortage is, in large part, a result of the exploitative practices of those dodgy contractors, which have led to a lack of interest in pursuing careers in construction due to bad pay, long working hours, and inadequate worker protections (story of our lives in the 21st century am I right, medical sector included).\n\nThe construction sector's ongoing labor shortage hampers our ability to build enough affordable housing to meet the growing demand. Shit contractors who underpay workers and disregard their rights are not only contributing to the shortage but also perpetuating the cycle of unaffordable housing. This situation has a detrimental impact on the overall quality of housing and makes it even more challenging for aspiring homeowners to enter the market.\n\nTo address this issue effectively, it's crucial to crack down on contractors and orgs who take advantage of vulnerable workers. Strengthening regulations and enforcement mechanisms can ensure that workers receive fair wages, decent working hours, and proper protections. Additionally, investing in training programs and initiatives to attract and retain skilled workers in the construction industry will help alleviate the labor shortage over the long term. Moreover, we must advocate for improved working conditions and safety standards in the construction sector. When workers are treated fairly and with dignity, they are more likely to stay in the industry, creating a stable and skilled workforce that can keep up with housing demand.\n\n**Feel free to contend or bring up anymore points you want to discuss I have a free couple of hours tonight :> also I would recommend reading about Housing First in Finland it's amazing they have reduced their homeless population to zero and everyone has a home and it was crazy easy to implement!!**"}, {"author": "MJV-88", "created": 1691137115.0, "text": "There are plenty of countries much older than Australia, show me one example of a pension system that\u2019s collapsed once a country ages beyond Australia\u2019s level."}, {"author": "MJV-88", "created": 1691108106.0, "text": "Do it then.

There was a family of four very dirty people; mom, dad, son, daughter. They would come in, order a huge amount of food, eat some of it and destroy the general vicinity of where they ate with the rest of it. What is depicted here is nothing compared to what they did, though this is unacceptable regardless. Anything within ten feet of whichever table they chose would be *covered* in food, gravy, sauce and cheese. If they were near a wall or window, it would be smeared with the same. \n\nAfter this happened a few times, some of us spoke to the manager about the issue. She said that they were paying customers and that we got paid to clean, so we had to serve them. \n\nOne night, less than half an hour before we closed, the dirty family walked in. I was already dreading it; we had done most of the end of day cleaning already, and they'd set us back over an hour after closing *at least*. They attempted to place an order to dine in, but the other cashier bumped in and said because we were about to close, they'd need to take the food to go. I was relieved, and the dirty father said \"okay, we'll just go to Burger King.\" As though they simply could not consume food *without* destroying the local area, and knew better than to do that to a space of their own they'd need to clean.\n\nThe manager came out as they were leaving, asked what happened. Other cashier answered her and she fired him on the spot. They spent like $70+ on food each time they came in, so she fired him for costing the company that money. \n\nI quit not long after for different reasons, related to the manager's conduct.

They discount until they have a large market share and have driven most of the competition into the ground.

Along the way they demand volume discounts from the suppliers because they are selling bulk volume units of stock.This means that they are still making a good profit margin % compared to the smaller competitors, while still being cheaper. Once there is less competition, they gradually reduce their discounting, so the customers don't notice the reduction in discounts, while still maintaining the mental image that Company X has good prices, even when they don't.\n\nSecond: The sale of physical media has gone down so much that they may not be getting the volume discounts from distributors that they used to get.
