Some people listened to their scare tactics, probably trying to get people to sell so they could continue padding their pockets. Or maybe they honestly believed it and just wanted publicity. Who really knows? But the story tells itself. It went up to $400, then $450... There were occasional dips, but the trend line has remained consistent. My favorite is when an analyst \"downgrades\" the stock and then you see it dip 7-10% in a single day. You panic, get a little frustrated, but keep holding. If you're smart, you buy more. Years later, it's now split and almost back at the price those analysts were screaming \"overvalued!\" at.

These are often moments where institutions will take the opportunity to buy stock at lower prices preparing for future growth.

Consumer debt is also on the rise with increases in delinquency rates.\n\nIf you are betting all your money on Nvidia I would advise caution.\n\nDon't invest what you cannot afford to lose or hold for many years. Always keep 5-6 months of emergency funds in a HYSA.

AI compute used for training today is substantial, but less than 50% and will keep declining as a percentage.   \n\nTime is required to validate and research different SOTA models using this approach (there's a lot more than just LLMs), develop hardware, adopt the approach, and develop an ecosystem. \n\nIMO\n\n1. This paper is exciting because it brings us closer to having powerful edge AI solutions (e.g. robots, autonomous vehicles, AI on personal devices) where power and compute are both at a premium and usage is almost all inference. APPL and MSFT should be interested.\n\n2. Using arithmetic with ternary values is a simple operation compared to floating point. It's unclear that Nvidia would be able to maintain a moat for inference. \n\n3. If approaches like this pan out, it would most likely take years before impacting NVDA at the datacenter. However, the impact could be much sooner for edge AI. \n\nSource: Claude 3.5 and GPT 4o discussing this paper with me moderating. Here's the tail end of a lengthy discussion where their conclusions agree that the FP reduction could be around 30% for training and 90% for inference. No one really knows for sure though, without more independent research.  \n\n------------\n\nChat GPT 4o concurs with Claude 3.5 on 90% reduction in FP operations for inference.\n\nGPT 4o summarizing both views for training: \n\nWhile the MatMul-free approach provides substantial efficiency gains, particularly in reducing the computational complexity of the forward pass, the overall training process still requires significant FP operations, especially during the backward pass. Therefore, a more conservative estimate of around 25-30% reduction in FP operations during the entire training process is more realistic.\n\nThis balanced view acknowledges the significant contributions of the paper while maintaining a realistic perspective on the extent of FP operation reductions in training.\n\nClause 3.5 Sonnet on Nvida moat for this approach: \n\nThis approach is indeed different enough that CUDA, in its current form, would not provide as strong a moat for inference chips specifically designed for this ternary arithmetic approach. The fundamental differences in computation could create an opening for competitors to develop new, highly optimized solutions without the need to compete directly with CUDA's strengths.\n\nHowever, several factors mitigate this risk for NVIDIA:\n\n1. NVIDIA's resources and expertise could allow them to quickly adapt and develop optimized solutions for this new approach.\n2. The broader AI ecosystem, including training and other non-ternary models, would still benefit from CUDA.\n3. NVIDIA's overall hardware expertise and manufacturing capabilities remain significant advantages.\n\nIn summary, while this approach could reduce CUDA's effectiveness as a moat specifically for ternary-based inference chips, NVIDIA's overall position in the AI hardware market would likely remain strong due to their ability to adapt, their broader ecosystem, and their hardware expertise. The impact would be more pronounced if this approach becomes dominant in both training and inference across a wide range of AI applications."}], "created": 1719419553.0}, {"title": "\u2705 Daily Chat Thread and Discussion \u2705", "author": "AutoModerator", "score": 21, "comments": [{"author": "Fladap28", "created": 1719237711.0, "text": "I gotta say there rly isn\u2019t any indication for the dip but I guess the stock market will stock market"}], "created": 1719201649.0}, {"title": "Is it time to go full regards again?

I'm a long term holder of NVDA, and here's some bad news:    And end is coming for NVDA trading in these types of nose bleed ranges.\n\nToday is a fun time as a shareholder, new ATHs coming one after the other.  But look a the **history of this stock is it exhibits big peaks and big valleys in the share price** over time.   So don't get caught up in FOMO if you want to own this company long term.\n\nSo when you ask is it passed a transformative buy?  At this moment?  Sure anything over 2-3x in the next 5 years is going to be hard from $700+.    But in two years in the future it could be trading for 50% of the current price.   It's happened before (I saw an 80% decline at one point), and I think some >20% downs going to happen again.   One should **view that as an opportunity**, rather than a *disaster,* as I'm certain the the FOMO/YOLO crowd would.   This would be in accord with Warren Buffet's idea to  [be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/012116/warren-buffett-be-fearful-when-others-are-greedy.asp)\n\nThe second thing is the **opportunities** in front of this company, and the way management is approaching.   I remain in awe over strategy, execution and  potential.  Beyond AI, there are public initiatives on Automotive, Omnivers/Digital Twins, Quantum, Digital Biology, Agriculture, Physics, Manufacturing, Pharmaceuticals, Robotics and dozens of others -- many I'm sure are not even public -- that GPUs and ML can take to the next level.    Not all of these will pay out, but some will for sure.  Nvidia are also investing heavily in AI startups, 1000s of them, through their Inception Program.    [Nvidia believes they are working towards a $1T TAM.](https://imgur.com/a/4Jv2syl)\n\nSo if you really want to hitch your wagon to Nvidia for the long term, my advice is to **take your time and be discriminating about choosing your entry point**.   That's not a good answer for the crowd who demands instant gratification, but it worked for me.   My last buy point was $120 last Oct, so these opportunities do present themselves periodically and if you're prepared for them you can use them to your advantage.
