She isn't the most successful historically, nor the most successful in the past year. \n\nOdd, though, that if somebody looks at Brian Higgins and his returns, they see that they were from NVDA bought in 2021. \n\nMost Democrats tend to follow tech stocks, and rising sectors. Republicans are starting to have lower and lower returns because of the stagnant, backward thought process of investing in oil companies, sinking sectors, etc.. And we can trace a lot of this behavior to the very ethos of each party, ideology, etc...\n\nIt's funny, too, that more liberal members of Congress will still try to regulate, regardless of their investments.\n\nWhile people like McCaul (R), blatantly advocate for policy and law that would directly benefit them. Keep the country and the entire planet held back with their regressive policy, simply for personal gain.\n\nI am a hardcore progressive. Many of you would call me a \"sOciAlisT, cOmMy, MarXiSt\", and would be correct in 1 of 3. But I also exist in this world and am invested in NVDA and VOO for my wife and I, our retirement, etc..\n\nThe entire framing is fucking weird.\n\nIf somebody wants to debate policy, like how members should be restricted in their ability to trade while in Congress, I'm game. Otherwise, I would welcome an explanation as to why people still single out Pelosi.

The sell off wasn\u2019t that much and a lot of this had to do with Jackson Hole.\n\nAs far as NVDA rallying today that was in line with J Powells dovish speech at Jackson Hole. This sort of movement is fairly consistent with economics data reporting and Fed speak. If you look at the other players in tech you will see a similar chart. AAPL chart looks almost identical to NVDA this AM. \n\nAs for the NVDA rally coming\u2026that has a lot to do with Hyper-scalers reporting continued CAPEX spend on data centers this earnings season. It is generally considered that NVDA will beat and raise.\n\nHe is speaking more to historical trends and TA with QQQ and Nasdaq. The RSI on the 1D for NVDA was not horribly overbought. The RSI was in the 60\u2019s and can be pegged above 80 for a few days before reversing. Which can be seen on the 1D chart for some of these big moves this year. The opposite is the RSI getting into the 20\u2019s where an oversold condition tends to reverse fairly soon after on these Mega Cap stocks.\n\nSo to boil down his post in simple terms : RSI looking overbought, trends showing upside.\n\nKeep in mind historically the fall is bullish and extremely bullish post election. So if NVDA beats and confirms the Hyper-scaler CAPEX spend with increased revenue then yes it will rally just like it did last quarter. Going into the fall it could rally even more with the entire SP500 as rate cuts will most likely occur.\n\nThere is a little more at play here than technical analysis. Don\u2019t get me wrong I use TA daily here. But news/economics plays into this as well as fundamentals.\n\nWhat was interesting and he has not responded to my comment on another thread. A few months ago he made a point of saying NVDA would be stuck in the 120\u2019s because of the problem with reaching a 3 trillion market cap. Basically saying it had reached a peak along with most companies at 3T. Now he is saying 200 is the high which would put NVDA at close to a 5 trillion market cap.

Many times the RSI will push past both of those. A 20/80 RSI setting is good. A stock can go above a 80 RSI and be pegged for days to the upside before selling off. In most cases if a stock hits a 20 RSI a reversal is fast. The 1 Day chart is really good at seeing this.

Profit taking and extremely overbought market.  The NASDAQ-100 just rallied from $341 to $503 without a correction.  That\u2019s an insanely large rally without a retracement.  Probably one of the largest gains on the record without a correction.  \n\nThe S&P went on one of its longest stretches in history without a correction. \n\nCorrections create opportunity in the market.  At $503 on the QQQ valuations were getting stretched and there wasn\u2019t a lot of opportunity.\n\nNow there is.  That\u2019s how it goes.  We rally for 5-6 months, and then correct.  This past year we did a 5-6 month rally, corrected 8% which was really minor, rallied another 5-6 months and then correction 15%.  So what.  This happens like clockwork.  \n\nGo back 20 years and you\u2019ll see two corrections like this every year.  \n\nAnd guess what?  In every one of them, there\u2019s talk of bear markets and recessions.  You can\u2019t have a recession every year.  \n\nJust look at the data divorced from the current fear mongering.  GDP is 2.8.  Job growth is STILL taking place.  \n\nWe still haven\u2019t had a negative jobs report.  Think about that. \n\nAnd all the while the feds are SELLING bonds and haven\u2019t cut rates yet.

I agree that it was a whole market went down, just NVDA got hit harder. I think the biggest things to worry about at the moment are the next unemployment reading or the cpi reading. Because if inflation is still up and unemployment is going up then that would be a double spiral that can send the market down.\n\nMany indexers say just to be in the index because you're not putting all your eggs in basket and that NVDA the company could not exist in 50 years or end up like Sears. Or it could be very volatile and your taking on that extra volatitility, variance, and risk that you may not get a higher return from.\n\nWhen those good days happen though it does feel like NVDA blows the indexes out the water and the indexes just chug along and maybe go up a dollar or two a day. However, if the market drops like today NVDA may go down 15 points and the index only goes down 6 points. So, that's what is having me considering indexes is to avoid the drawdowns, and have more steady swings up and down. Along with less fees and taxes, or worries of having to time the market to sell at the right time.\n\nAt the same time, I feel like index investing is overhyped and takes the soul and interest out of investing. But, people say that you can't beat the expers, and it's like picking a needle in a haystack. NVDA literally makes up 15 to 30% of some indexes, so is that really a needle in a haystack, or is that a chunk of the haystack that is painted a certain color lol?\n\nLike you said, it has happened at previous times that after drawdowns the market sometimes responds back quickly in an upward direction as well. There's so many negative factors that can push the market down at the moment. Especially with the job market being so bad. I'm worried if I lose my job, that I won't even have as much of a cash cushion avaialble to invest."}, {"author": "No Author", "created": 1722866086.0, "text": "1. False dichotomy.

At some point the selling will stop but, we still won\u2019t get rallies as strong as before because there will be less liquidity and more risk aversion. \n\nAnd to add fuel to the fire, the economic data on  jobs growth and inflation was substantially weaker than expected this past week.

The \"Big Picture\" is this - back in 2006, Nvidia created\u00a0a software development platform, Cuda, which is at the heart of the inference portion of generative artificial intelligence. Software developers have been writing on this platform, and it gives Nvidia a huge lead on all comers. NVDA started working on Blackwell and its predecessors more than 12 years ago. NVDA (Jensen) had conviction that all of the things that are happening would get done and get done quickly. I think a lot of people don\u2019t realize that it isn\u2019t just one wave that Jensen is riding, he\u2019s straddling two of them. First, he is pioneering accelerated computing. We had been stuck in a world of chips, dominated by Intel, that could have many functions. To have all these functions, the chips ran slower than we realized until Jensen showed us what could happen. He understood that gamer chips had to be faster than Intel\u2019s chips. So, he designed them that way. And he designed many generations basically in his head just waiting for all of the equipment to catch up to where his brain was already. Accelerated computing, putting his chips ahead of all other chips, wasn\u2019t known when his stock was worth $500 billion.\n\nFast forward today, do not get confused by the \"fog\" of earnings and/or day to day machinations of the stock price . . . unless you are an options trader.

We don\u2019t know what will come of earnings or what type of rally we\u2019re going to see in the Nasdaq.  \n\nLet me give you an example of why that type of outlook is difficult to forecast.  \n\nThe QQQ rallied from $341 up to $450 over 103 trading session (32%) between November 2023 and April 2024.  That\u2019s 6 consecutive months of non/stop rallying and the biggest pullback we saw in that time was 4%.  After an 8% correction in April, the QQQ rallied for over 40 trading sessions from May to July.  The run went from $411 to $503.50. \n\nWe finally just had a real correction.  The QQQ fell from $503.50 down to $423.  That\u2019s $80 or 16%.  \n\nSince then it has rallied back 12%.  \n\nOkay.  So let\u2019s consider question #1.  What we\u2019d need to know is whether this is going to be like the Nov-April rally where the QQQ runs 30% over 103 days or the May-July rally over 40-days.

The sell off wasn\u2019t that much and a lot of this had to do with Jackson Hole. \n\nAs far as NVDA rallying today that was in line with J Powells dovish speech at Jackson Hole. This sort of movement is fairly consistent with economics data reporting and Fed speak. If you look at the other players in tech you will see a similar chart. AAPL chart looks almost identical to NVDA this AM\n\nAs for the NVDA rally coming\u2026that has a lot to do with Hyper-scalers reporting continued CAPEX spend on data centers this earnings season. It is generally considered that NVDA will beat and raise. \n\nHe is speaking more to historical trends and TA with QQQ and Nasdaq. The RSI on the 1D for NVDA was not horribly overbought. The RSI was in the 60\u2019s and can be pegged above 80 for a few days before reversing. The opposite is the RSI getting into the 20\u2019s where an oversold condition tends to reverse fairly soon after on these Mega Cap stocks. \n\nSo to boil down his post in simple terms : RSI looking overbought, trends showing upside.\n\nKeep in mind historically the fall is bullish and extremely bullish post election. So if NVDA beats and confirms the Hyper-scaler CAPEX spend with increased revenue then yes it will rally just like it did last quarter. Going into the fall it could rally even more with the entire SP500 as rate cuts will most likely occur. \n\nThere is a little more at play here than technical analysis. Don\u2019t get me wrong I use TA daily here. But news/economics plays into this as well as fundamentals.\n\nWhat was interesting and he has not responded to my comment on another thread. A few months ago he made a point of saying NVDA would be stuck in the 120\u2019s because of the problem with reaching a 3 trillion market cap. Basically saying it had reached a peak along with most companies at 3T. Now he is saying 200 is the high which would put NVDA at close to a 5 trillion market cap.

You\u2019re betting on future growth. \n\nOptions are just riskier. But that\u2019s why people like to get options with long expirations. \n\nDo you think Nvidia will increase from its current price at any time between now and September 2025? You probably think so. I think so too.\n\nSo an option is just betting that will happen at some point (there\u2019s also theta decay but I\u2019m simplifying). It\u2019s highly unlikely that its price in this very moment is the highest it will go until September 2025. So that\u2019s not too dangerous of a gamble.\n\nAlso note that the share price doesn\u2019t need to reach $200.

This is high-risk high-return gambling, but with the catch that you get to choose your exit point. You can either wait for the contract to close, hopefully ITM, or close the position yourself at any point in time before its expiration date for a profit. Speculation is what most of the people here are doing.\n\nYou can use options to hedge your portfolio against sudden market moves. In this case, you buy an option and hope for it to expire worthless, at a loss to yourself. If the option is OTM at expiration, your portfolio should have gained enough to offset the loss. If the market takes a sudden downturn, your rights as an option holder will let you exit your positions without a major loss. This strategy is mostly used by large banks, not retail traders.\n\nMy personal favorite way to trade options is to use what's called an income strategy. In this case you would sell an option to gain an obligation that was already a part of your strategy. For example, if I wanted to enter a position on MSFT because I'm slightly bullish on the stock I would sell a cash-secured put that is likely to expire ITM, or in other words, with a delta of around 0.5 or greater. From the date of the sale to expiration, I would be at risk of assignment as long as the option is ITM. If I am not assigned before expiration, I walk away with the premium. If I am assigned, I buy into a position I planned to open anyways. Short calls and cash-secured puts are both income strategies.\n\nYou can gamble with options, or you can make them a part of a legitimate investment strategy.

But it's important to keep in mind that earnings mostly impacts the stock near-term.  Unless something truly fundamentally shifting happens, earnings will only have a near-term impact and NVDA will continue ahead in its general direction.  A delay isn't a fundamental shift. It's a small blip.\n\nA fundamental shift would be like NVDA coming out and saying that it's customer's aren't making money and are likely scaling back spending in the future. That would be bad.\n\nWhat we saw this past month was driven by a market correction.  It wasn't just NVDA falling. The entire market was taking a huge beating.  A 16% correction to be exact.  When the market moves lower in a correction, bad news takes center stage.  But it's important to understand that it's not the bad news that drives the stock lower. It's the stock selling off in lock-step with the market that drives bearish sentiment which in turn points to bad news as the reason.\n\nWhen the market is rallying, bad news is brushed aside and any piece of good news is highlighted. It's very counter-intuitive.  But that's basically how it works.\n\nI bet everyone invested in NVDA during the months of July and August were under the belief that NVDA dropped 30% due to some specific fundamental reason. The reality is NVDA dropped due to the correction in the broad market. Otherwise, how else can anyone explain how NVDA magically just rallied 45% in lock-step with the QQQ rallying 16%.  The supposed bad-news we heard all last month is still there. And yet here's NVDA trading up to $130 a share from $90. That's a near 50% move higher right?  And for what reason exactly?  What news came out that can be attributed to that 50% move higher?  I forecasted that move back in August 4-5 right?  And that forecast was based on the market bottoming out.  Stated news items don't always connect to the stock price. The financial press can say whatever they want.  But they don't know what 100's of thousands of market participants are doing.  They don't know what the top 70 hedge funds are doing and their decision making processes right?

That was the intended effect to bring down inflation. So rates were lowered to reverse something they caused, not to respond to something unrelated. \n\nThis time around the Fed has tried to bring down inflation with raised rates without causing a recession, using history as a guide to prevent a repeat of the 80s. Basically trying to not repeat a fuckup. \n\nIf rates stay high for too long then yeah there will be a recession eventually due to throttling economic activity.

I\u2019ll just echo what Capable_Wait09 has already said by adding there simply isn\u2019t a large enough sample size here.  We don\u2019t have all that many past historical events where the fed started cutting rates leading to a peak in the market.  \n\nAnd what\u2019s more, the last few times we\u2019ve seen that happen, there were a lot of other things happening in the world.  \n\nFor example, in the Greenspan era, we had the housing bubble and financial crisis.  The fed was forced to cut rates due to the Fanny/Freddy fiasco back in the summer of 2007 and that eventually lead to the Bear Stearns collapse and ultimately the financial crisis. \n\nThe fed was behind the curve back then and it was ultimately their own doing.  The underlying problems were taking place as they were raising rates.  \n\nThis current fed had very legitimate reason for raising rates in 2022 and have equally legitimate reasons to begin cutting.  \n\nThe point here is that those two markets don\u2019t quite match up.  \n\nWhat\u2019s more, there was a very big lag effect between when the fed began cutting rates in summer 2007 and when the market peaked in late 2008.  It was a good 4-6 months between those two things.  \n\nCertain segments of the market peaked in January 2008 ahead of the Bear Stearns collapse.  The fed began cutting rates in Aug-September 2007.  But remember, the fed was hawkish up until August 2007 when credit conditions began tightening.  I remember that period well.  It was one of my best trades ever.  I got super long a basket of different stocks (January options) across the board in Aug 2007 and it all paid off by Nov 2007.  \n\nBut really various segments in market were in okay shape throughout much of 2008 even. In August 2008 (a year after the fed began cutting), all of the big tech stocks like google and Apple were within a few percentage pints of their highs only a single month away from the financial crisis.  \n\nThe character of the Bernanke fed and that economic environment was very different than today.  The Bernanke fed went from hawkish to dovish in a single month driven by rapidly deteriorating financial conditions.  \n\nThe Powell fed has largely been very dovish and these upcoming rate cuts have been expected for nearly 6-8 months now.  The Powell fed is by no means \u201cforced\u201d like Bernanke had been.  \n\nIn 2007, it all happened very dramatically as the fed was forced to take action during a big market sell-off in August 2007.  \n\nAnd again, even in that situation, there was a big lag period between when the fed cut and when the market actually rolled over.  \n\nI make this point because I\u2019ve heard this whole thing before.  It\u2019s a known trend in the market.  \n\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say on this is that this bull market is brand new.  It only just started in January 2023.  It\u2019s not even 2-years old yet.  \n\nIn 2008, we were 5 years into the bull run before we peaked.  So even then I don\u2019t think this market environment really fits into that prior trend."}, {"author": "Appropriate-Thanks10", "created": 1724299771.0, "text": "Would a bear market even be that bad?

Just based on this, we will see computing requirements jump from Sora and other video diffusion models.\u00a0\n\nAfter that what's next? Robotics? Training robots to be fast and nimble and perform dexterity tasks such as folding laundry? Cleaning? Assisting hospice and eldery patients? Fulfilment centers? These will require an even larger data set of training and multimodal models. This is no longer training chatgpt.

They are following the textbook movements of a market bubble. Zoom out and look at where we are. A lower high bouncing off the underside of a prior parabolic run. Two massive leaps up, drop, retest, reject. classic bull trap. I held NVDA since $5.80 and closed my entire position out before this because it is a rational and predictable move. 2022 NVDA was exactly the same. I highly suggest examining that chart for comparison. ANF just completed the same pattern this week with a \\~18% drop and counting on good earnings results. These are rational and intelligible price movements if you know what you're looking at. Whether you believe in price patterns or think it's self-fulfilling prophecy, same outcome. \n\nPutting this in terms of the fundamentals... This is occurring because the market is weighing the idea that NVDA is too hot and massively overvalued. For comparison Meta has equally good or better fundamentals, trades 1/3 the valuation and is still subject to crumping in a broader market pull back. So despite bulls pointing to good earnings and guidance, NVDA stock has a thick layer of speculation on top of that and plenty of room for valuation compression if smart money decides to pull the rug and move from risk-on to risk-off.\n\nIn the bigger picture NVDA is solid and has good growth opportunities ahead. So the market could test a bottom and bounce right back, or it could take a few years to recovery. Long term i'm bullish. But each investor should be deciding whether they are capable of holding the bag to $40 and waiting however many years a recovery takes, or whether they are the type who fomo'd in at $90 and are going to panic sell all the way down and then miss the recovery.

Paying a higher price should lead to lower realized returns, all else equal. This is exactly what the historical record shows.\"\n\nThere are so many examples in this article about unferlooked sectors outperforming the new innovations.

Maybe you can enlighten me a bit.\n\nAs I understand it someone who owns shares can make a contact with someone else to buy shares at or before a certain time for a certain price. They collect a fee for providing the option and it\u2019s usually not a lot of money. Let\u2019s say for arguments sake it\u2019s $3 so a 100 share contract would cost $300. The owner of the shares keeps that money regardless of what happens. If the contract is fulfilled then he gives up his 100 shares if not he keeps them.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Yes, this is referred to as a \u201ccovered call\u201d where the seller of the contract (sometimes called the \u201cwriter\u201d) owns the shares they are writing an options contract for. \n\nWhen a writer doesn\u2019t own the share they are writing the option for, this is called \u201cnaked\u201d. \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI\u2019m guessing that the money the buyer of the contract can make is the difference between the price when it was opened until it is closed. If the price isn\u2019t met the contract expires worthless.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- correct. This is referred to as \u201cpremium\u201d. \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI may or may not be accurate with that...\n\n\u2014\u2014 everything was correct \u2014\u2014-\n\nSo my question is. You lost $10k. Did you have $10k worth of contracts which would have given you control over a large amount of shares \n\n\u2014\u2014- yes. I bought 20 contracts for $5. A contract represents 100 shares. $5 x 100 x 20 = $10,000. I had control over 2000 shares of $NVDA with the right to buy them for $130 a share, irrespective of their price, and I paid $10,000 to do so \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nor are you paying for the loss somehow? \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- my break even point was $135 a share. My option $130 plus my premium of $5. If the stock closed below $135, I lost my premium paid ($10,000). If the stock was above $135, I effectively made $2,000 dollars for every dollar it was above.\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nIs there a penalty above the price of the contact that you are liable for? \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- the entirety of MY loss is limited to the premium I paid \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nPerhaps that same difference in price that you stood to gain? \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 you lost me here brother \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIf that\u2019s true where does that money go?\n\n\n\u2014\u2014- since I\u2019m lost, I\u2019ll answer with Neverland \u2014\u2014-"}, {"author": "idwtlotplanetanymore", "created": 1725059331.0, "text": "Not OP, and i would suggest anyone asking such questions read a lot more before ever playing with options..but...\n\nOptions are fairly simple. Its a contract to buy(call) or sell(put) a number of shares(usually 1 contract controls 100 shares) at a specific price(strike) on or before a specific date(the most common type, north american contracts are on or before). As an aside, options do not infer voting rights, nor dividends.\n\nYour maximum risk differs for a call vs a put, and if you are long or short.\n\nIf you are long a contract, you have bought the rights to buy(call) someone else's shares, or put(sell) shares to someone else. Your risk is always limited to the premium you paid for that contract. You can choose to exercise that contract on any date on or before the expiration(north american contact). Example: You buy 1 call contract with a $10/share premium and a strike of $100 and expiration of date D. You pay 10 * 100=$1000 today for the contract, you are only ever risking $1000. You can sell it at any point up to the expiration for whatever the contract is currently trading at. Or you can choose to exercise it or or before some date in which case you need to pay another 100 * 100=$10000 and you are delivered 100 shares of XYZ. Your total price was 11,000, so its exactly the same as just buying each share for 110(+trade fees, per contract fees, and exercise fee). Or you can do nothing, and on date D+1 the contract expires worthless, all rights and obligations expire, and you have only lost the original $1000 you paid.\n\nIf you are the writer of the contract, or are short a contract. You have entered into a contract to either sell someone your shares(short call), or the obligation to buy shares from someone else(short put) upon demand if the contract it exercised. \n\nIf you sell short 1 put of XYZ at a premium of $10/share, and a strike of $100. You will collect 10 * 100=$1000. At any point on or before the expiration you may have to pay another $10000 for 100 shares if the other party chooses to exercise their contract. Your maximum risk is $11,000 less whatever the shares are worth when you sell them.\n\nIf instead you sell short 1 call of XYZ at a premium of $10/share and a strike of $100. You again collect $1000. But your risk may be infinite. If you own shares, you have written a covered call, and your risk is whatever you paid for the shares-$1000-$10000(and don't forget the lost opportunity cost of being forced to sell below market, the lost opportunity cost is potentially infinite but you don't pay it with dollars). If instead you do not have 100 shares, if you have written a naked short call, your real losses are potentially infinite. You will be forced to go to the market and buy 100 shares for whatever they cost, then deliver those shares for $10000. Practically speaking you don't need to go buy 100 shares instantly(tho your broker may force you to do so), you will be short 100 shares, but the risk is infinite until you buy shares to close out the short. Whenever you do buy shares, again you losses are whatever you paid for the shares -$11000.\n\nWhen someone chooses to exercise a contract, a random person who is short a contract is assigned the exercise, and they must in very little time fulfill the obligations. If you are short a contract, there is always a risk that you many be assigned at any time; and you must be ready for that\n\nAlso, not tax advice, but tax consequences also different if you are long vs short, they can also different for calls or puts. For example in the US closing a long call or put position can be short or long term capital gains when you close it depending on how long you have owned it. Closing a short call/put position is always short term capital gains no matter how long you have owned it. If you choose to exercise a call, that is not a taxable event. If you choose to exercise a put, that is a taxable event. If you are assigned on a short call that is a taxable event. If you are assigned on a short put, that is not a taxable event.\n\n-------------\n\nSo with that, how did they lose 10k. They could have bought a contract for $10000+X and sold it for X, or they could have bought a contract(s) for $10000 and it expired worthless. Or they could have sold short and had to close at a loss of 10000, etc."}, {"author": "TreyAU", "created": 1725054587.0, "text": "The day I finally felt free was the day I fully realized it\u2019s all made up and the points don\u2019t matter."}, {"author": "TreyAU", "created": 1725127253.0, "text": "Yes.

Also, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it.\u00a0[https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed](https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed)\n\nCouple things\n\n1. they are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory.\n2. they are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell\n3. Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next.\n4. They're not being truthful about tokens per s.

So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit.\n\nOn pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) + .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million.\n\nfor regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1\n\n3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33\n\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)\n\nFrom this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second.

What's missing from this cartoon is the empty bag that Bugs may end up holding when the money manipulating this stock decides it's not worth running it up again. Because whether you completely realize it or not, this company just posted positive earnings and TANKED. If it were the first one in the business I could shake it off, but it's not. What that tells me is semiconductors are being manipulated across the board. Because the behavior of the stocks is no longer commensurate with the results of the businesses. That's VERY dangerous to be involved in. Because you're not really investing in companies anymore. You're investing in the whims of either one very large trader, or a collection of them all doing the same things to the point of manipulation. Well, to be more precise, you're investing in the whims of an algorithm. What's a trading algorithm? A digital sociopath that will do whatever it has to do to accomplish its goal, which is making money. Up to and including destroying the companies and/or other investors involved. \n\nSo yeah, I'm still holding. I have to because I traded to the point of $124. So I did pick up some money out of this thing, and I'm not giving it back. But I NEVER expected this or any other stock to flat out TANK on positive earnings. Usually just MEETING the street will produce a nominal gain, but the worst a stock normally does is stay flat. Nope, not NVDA. It TANKED on earnings BEATING the street. I took that as a canary in the coal mine. \n\nNo, that's not an invitation for all sorts of blibbety-blah rationalization about folks expecting more than street estimates. Which folks? Because the money moving this stock isn't coming from a Schwab account. It's much more than likely coming from the people publishing those very estimates. I \\*HAVE\\* seen this before. The first time I noticed the behavior it was a little slower. It was back in the 90's, right before \\*\\*\\*KABOOM\\*\\*\\*. No, I'm not saying that's about to happen here. But what I am saying is that it's even worse. Because to some degree human behavior can be understood when studied well enough.

And then in 2 generations GPUs will be fast enough to train the Blackwell models in 10 days and the cycle will continue.\n\nThat is the nature of compute and has been the case for decades. What many don't understand. Accelerated computing and AI is at the beginning and ramping. It's basically like tradition computing in the 90s which saw huge performance gains from generation to generation.\n\nOf course, you could continue use your old compute HW but the new HW makes it obsolote quite quickly. You can run your DC with 10000 Amperes for one modern model or you can install 10000 Blackwells and run a much larger model or 10x the modern model on it. If competition does that, will you risk not doing it? Why do you think all Hyperscalers talk about the risk of underinvesting? None of them will cry, the arms race stops now. No, it will stop when the performance gains from generations to generations will be less impactful. But that will be interesting because Nvidia is improving not only chip but data center performance.

Any old GPU from 7 years ago would outperform any modern CPU easily on any AI compute with >10x or more performance.\n\nBut the same GPUs are totally useless today compared to modern GPUs. For example, the original ChatGPT was trained on 10000 A100 over several months. The A100 is 4 years old. Compared to this, the same training on 10000 Blackwells would have been just 10 days. Will you continue to use your 10000 A100 if you 500-1000 of the new GPUs are equally fast and competition buys that?\n\nOr to see it in another perspective. If you're a gamer, how often have you switched GPUs in the 90s/2000s compared to today? And why more often back then? Because there have been leaps in performance and SW. The same applies currently to AI. The leaps are huge from generation to generation so 4 years old AI accelerators are jut really bad compared to latest generation.

You can't keep dropping the precision. But that said, let's say Blackwell is better. It's a dangerous game to extrapolate innovation just because of some other innovation in the past, e.g. consider the [miniaturization limits for GPUs](https://epochai.org/blog/predicting-gpu-performance).\n\nThe hyperscalers talk about the risk of under-investing, while at the same time, acknowledge that they're over-investing. Can't imagine this will be the case forever, these are some well-run behemoths that will reach a run-rate pace of investment in this technology. Besides, not everyone will be a winner in AI end use-cases so some players will be dropping out of the race. ROI on capex will be a big deciding factor here.\n\nThe obsolescence argument can be applied both ways. At some point, companies will try to make the existing HW work rather than pour yet another hundred billion dollars into the newest GPUs, when they just did the same thing a couple of quarters ago. I'd argue that the ramp-up phase for Generative AI is *now* (\u00b12 years).\n\nBesides, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Tesla etc. are working on custom chips for their own large use-cases. Even if Nvidia continues to dominate the long-tail of AI workloads, the large ones may be customized away, which will hurt Nvidia.\n\nAll that being said, I agree that Nvidia has a great future ahead. But in investing, there is too high a price to pay for a great business.

AMD will also be competing, and will be offering their GPUs at a much lower price. Amazon has started offering  AMD\u2019s GPU solutions as well, which are much cheaper.

That's the result of smaller margins...\n\n3-Those margins, they're CLOSING. They're going to have lower margins the back half of Fiscal '25 according to Huang.\n\n4-You have to be smart enough to look at more than just \"expectations,\" and say, 'well, NVDA beat, that's great.\" No, as I just wrote in a post a couple days ago, if they JUST beat or meet, they're going to drop 25%.\n\nThe \"whisper\" numbers for NVDA were 33/34M revenue.

They've gone from...something-31.6%, 19.4%, 11.9% and 9.8% is 3.8% over expectations. DECELERATION. At a forward PE of 40, you're pricing in 40X their current earnings to justify this current evaluation. Tech stocks are higher. They have more growth...so when their growth slows, they get beat up for it, just like AMZN, GOOGL, TSM had INCREDIBLE earnings.

There IS a miss in this report. NET REVENUE.\n\nLet me dumb it down for you. They were supposed to be shipping Blackwell in Q2(very limited) en mass in Q3 and entire Data Centers were supposed to be built with them in Q4.\n\nThey were projected to have 80B of revenue over the next 2 Quarters. Now, they're guiding for 32.5 and if their % keeps up, that'll be lower margin and a \\~33.5M quarter and that's not going to be good(they'll beat that, it's hypothetical).\n\nThis was mediocre earnings for a company trading at a \\~45 Forward PE and with their Growth. The Mag 7 stocks have had to not just beat, they've had to beat by a LOT or they dropped. This was especially true of NVDA.\n\nLong story short, you need to understand investing better than to look at analysts' expectations(Which are NOT traders' expectations, they were 32-34B) and say, \"Well, they beat top line, beat bottom line, sure, the actual money they made missed, but you can't call this a miss!\n\nNVDA is going to flounder for the next 2 Quarters. Blackwell is going to be what drives them back up. That's 3 Quarters from now.\n\nQ4 NVDA SHOULD get back to REAL meaningful beats, but they're not they're likely a quarter away from that and that's why the Stock isn't headed for 145-160 as projected, that's why it'll likely trade 115-130 with a low in the 105 range this next Quarter."}, {"author": "Three_sigma_event", "created": 1724923728.0, "text": "I'm not talking about Nvidia.

Contrary to your self-proclaimed expertise, you don't seem to have any financial knowledge at all.\n\nYou wrote a long essay essentially saying \"AI is cool, it's definitely the future, and so NVidia will moon\".\n\nEven assuming that is 100% true (and I've heard this very recently with Web3 and government-mandated EVs), I don't see any reason to take on Concentration Risk on a single stock. If AI is the future, the AI companies like Meta and Google will do very well. The web services companies like Amazon and Microsoft will do very well (these requests need to go somewhere). The companies selling you phones and computers to access AI will do very well. The banks with AI to reduce lending risks will do very well. The companies building productivity tools will do very well (Salesforce, Adobe).\n\nIn other words, if you truly believe \"AI\" is what you claim it will be, a broad index fund will still capture a large amount of gains, without the Concentration Risk. If the picture you're painting turns out to be true, somebody invested in QQQ or S&P 500 will continue to see >15% CAGR for the next decade, which is plenty enough to make most investors happy.\n\nThis isn't even true for previous hypes. If EVs turned out to be the future, only the EV companies will reap the benefits, not the rest of the market. If Web3 was to replace Web2, then owning Meta stocks wouldn't have done you much good.\n\nAnd there is always Concentration Risk, no matter how good the company. Production might not scale after a certain point. Look at how everyone is begging for new planes and Airbus can't take advantage because they can't build planes fast enough. Look at how NVidia themselves couldn't fill shelves for months during the Bitcoin mining hype. Or large companies may decide to build their own vertically integrated stacks. Sure, hardware performance may not match NVidia's. But anyone who's used an iPhone knows the power of vertically integrated products, meaning the end result can vastly outperform even superior hardware. Or all of NVidia's employees could lose motivation to improve after becoming millionaires. Or Jensen could be in a car accident or be discovered to be best friends with Jeff Epstein. Or China can invade Taiwan. Point is, you never know when you put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nLet me reiterate, I'm not trying to argue with you whether \"AI is the future\" or whether \"NVidia will moon because AI is the future\". I'm just saying that even if everything you say is true, the average investor will probably do better with an ETF. The gains of AI aren't exclusive to NVidia.\n\nSure, if you want to play around with ER and make a quick buck, especially with options, then be my guest.

If AI adoption slows or fails to meet lofty expectations, Nvidia\u2019s stock could face significant downward pressure.\n\n3. **Dismissal of Traditional Valuation Metrics**: The author\u2019s rejection of P/E ratios and other conventional valuation metrics could be risky. Ignoring these can lead to overestimating Nvidia\u2019s true value and missing signs of overvaluation.\n\n4. **Underestimated Competitive Risks**: The analysis downplays potential competition from other tech giants and new market entrants. If competitors catch up, Nvidia\u2019s market share and growth prospects could be severely impacted.\n\n5. **Geopolitical Risks Not Fully Accounted For**: The analysis underestimates the geopolitical risks associated with China and Taiwan. Any escalation could disrupt Nvidia\u2019s supply chain and hurt its financial performance, challenging its current valuation.\n\n6. **Dependence on Speculative AI Progress**: The assumption that AI will continue to advance rapidly without any major setbacks is speculative. If AI development slows or hits technological barriers, Nvidia\u2019s valuation could be significantly overstated.\n\n7. **Market Cap Assumptions Are Unrealistic**: The idea that Nvidia could reach a market cap of $3-5 trillion might be unrealistic, especially considering historical trends and the potential for market saturation.\n\n8. **Volatility Ignored in Price Target**: While acknowledging volatility, the $164 price target might not fully account for potential sharp corrections, making the valuation appear more stable than it actually is.\n\n9. **Overreliance on AI Applications**: The broad applications of AI listed do not guarantee that Nvidia will capture the majority of this value, particularly with growing competition in AI hardware and software.\n\n10. **High Valuation Reflects Speculative Future Earnings**: Nvidia\u2019s current valuation might be pricing in future earnings that are far from certain.

They offer in-depth reports on companies, giving you access to data that can guide your decisions on stock valuation and market outlook.\nYou\u2019ll also find Value Line to be a fantastic tool, especially if you\u2019re looking for concise reports on company performance, financial strength, and future prospects. Their rankings and analysis are a great way to compare companies.\nAnd finally, Morningstar is well-known for its analysis of mutual funds and ETFs, but they also provide excellent stock research. Their star ratings are particularly useful for understanding the long-term outlook of investments. If they are saying all the same things about a stock you can aggregate this info to help make your decision. Hope this helps."}, {"author": "No Author", "created": 1723842798.0, "text": "[removed]"}, {"author": "rac_srevird", "created": 1723774008.0, "text": "I bought around the 120 range, hypothetically, if earnings turn that bad, would you sell all your shares?"}, {"author": "reddit-abcde", "created": 1723839438.0, "text": "30-40 years?!  \nWhen will you sell?"}, {"author": "RemindMeBot", "created": 1723830994.0, "text": "I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2025-08-16 17:55:48 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-08-16%2017:55:48%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1etainr/we_holding/lifwkxw/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FNVDA_Stock%2Fcomments%2F1etainr%2Fwe_holding%2Flifwkxw%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202025-08-16%2017%3A55%3A48%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%201etainr)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|"}, {"author": "Scourge165", "created": 1723832686.0, "text": ">I do not let newspaper articles that are covering the soup of the day determine my buying or selling.\n\nRight.

They rent a bunch of computing from the data centers and they hope that efficiency will help their bottom line. \n\nI agree the growth will slow down, but I doubt it will decline or slow down significantly for years. I do expect the margins will gradually shrink, but that margin can be cut in half and it would still be better than the margins for the vast majority of businesses in the world. \n\nThe problem is that NVDA is a crowded trade and people who want in first have to pay the highest prices while everyone else waits in line. That is how it is and it isn't going to change until the fomo dies down a lot. I own NVDA stock and I trade options. I dca a tiny miniscule amount each day the market is open. I make good money on the option spreads I do because of the all the nuts who think the stock will go way up any day now. It wont. It will however go up rapidly on a day when people aren't expecting it. It will also plunge a few times when people dont expect it will. That is just how volatile stocks work. The volatility is part of the game. \n\nMy view is that in 10 years the stock will be up a lot. I expect it will see multiple 20% swings and those will be painful if you bought shares on the way up. So I buy dips and sell a little anytime the price spikes hard."}, {"author": "K1mbler", "created": 1724965202.0, "text": "The worlds demand for compute at the lowest price/performance and TCO is just getting started.

The trend is expected to continue.  Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in Q4 and continue into fiscal 2026, and we expect to ship several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in the fourth quarter.  Hopper shipments are also expected to increase in the second half of the fiscal year as supply improves.  Blackwell revenue will be additive to Hopper revenue, at least until Blackwell supply meets demand, which isn\u2019t going to happen this year.

I invested nearly all my money in income stocks.  For the past two months I was getting healthy dividends and that if I did a sell right now, I might break even.  However, I know that if my checking account suffers, I can sell and take a loss if necessary.  All of the stocks I bought were much higher than they have been recently.  But, knowing this, I told myself to take a deep breath and wait because although this is low now, this will change and I believe it will soon.  I just wish I had more money to  buy in right now when it is so low.  I have invested what I can right now and what hurts is not being able to buy more now!!!

My desire is that when CONY hits the number of my average investment cost, I would like to sell and put the money into QQQY which offers a healthy dividend monthly as do the others.  QQQY estimated dividend is usually 2.5026 per share.  CONY Est. Dividend pays 1.006 right now but was paying a lot more.  \n\nAnd, YBTC dividend is 2.0622.  Another fantasy of mine. \n\nOne thing one must be aware of in these kinds of stocks is that when the market dips so much, dividends will be smaller. MSTY pays well also.  I usually receive my dividends on the 8th of the month and they sit pending in my \"history\" a few days before they are paid.  So far, nothing.   This is what one has to be prepared for with volatile income stocks.\n\nBTW, I have noticed that J.P. Morgan stocks have been pretty stable. JEPY (l.6746) is also good in my opinion.  You might want to read the article JEPI vs JEPY. There is good info on stocks everywhere.  I believe these two are very good and relatively stable.

They also have loads of info on each stock. \n\nBottom line, I will  be patient because I know the market will correct and my stocks will once again be in the green and doing well.  Patience is the key for any investor.  It is imperative. Knee jerk emotional reactions would only bring mistakes and unsettling thoughts. Just my experiences, and, one other thing, I love investing as it is exciting for me just as the current anticipation is.   \n\nAlso, I am new to investing but I had a mentor.

It doesn't matter that it's a solid company if the whole market crashes like it does every 6 years on average.

I'm in my 30's and consider myself a very good, advanced level stock investor now. You know how I got to where I am? By making (a lot) of mistakes. If you're not the old fashioned \"buy and hold forever\" Warren Buffet fanboy, I think the only way you truly get good at investing in stocks is to get your hands dirty. Invest in real money, make mistakes, and feel the pain of doing things *wrongly*. But, this rides on my next statement...\n\nI'd first ask yourself, *why* did you invest in these stocks? Did you think you were gonna make a quick buck of NVDA or TSM? Or are you seriously interested in being a stock investor? It's a serious question. Did you just do this to make a quick couple buck, or are you in it to win it? Do you want to make this a serious side hustle? My portfolio is serious business. I wanna retire young and not kiss ass in life. If you did this just thinking you were gonna make a quick buck, the stock market isn't for you, period. So this tidbit of advice is for your future, if and whenever you decide to cash out.\n\n\n\nMoving forward; you're asking about if you should sell now? No. If you don't need the money for something very important right now, leave your investments the hell alone. You're emotional investing. If it makes you feel any better about the situation, I think you bought in at a great price... I bought $15,000 worth of NVDA at around that $116 mark. I'm a very iron-clad investor. I don't look at my portfolio every day, especially when the markets red. I don't care about news, wars, Cramer, Trump, recessions, depressions, supply issues, government crap, etc. You know why? Because the lot of it is propaganda that leads to emotional investing. And furthermore, everything I just talked about, it has *little-to-nothing* to do with how valuable a company actually is.\n\nI'm invested in NVDA because I know they are a behemoth of a tech company, with hardware that is **literal years** ahead of the competition. They're run by a tried-and-true CEO that built the company from dirt. I feel 100% confident with investing in them. I invested in NVDA before it was cool. And you know what? None of that makes them invincible. I could be wrong about all of this. But, that is part of the game. If I were to lose all of my money in NVDA, at least I knew I was doing it in something I believed in and an investment I made in good faith.\n\n\n\nKeep educating yourself and move forward. Decide what YOU want to do with the future of your stocks. If you are gonna play the game, learn the rules, and keep your emotions in check. And I saw your comment here, saying the stock market is gambling. **The stock market is NOT gambling**. It's only gambling if you play it that way. Doing what you did is gambling. People betting their whole life savings on speculative options is gambling. Trying to make a quick buck and buying a stock cause everyone else buys it is gambling.

Because he doesn't understand the sector, and he needs to stop writing about it at a major publication. The same goes for too many others. The fossils that will never understand the sector in general need to lose their seat at the table. Alpert has been writing for Barrons since 1984. It's time for his gold watch and cardboard box. Hell it's time for diapers.

This is a positive indicator of the company\u2019s performance.\n2. *Accounts Receivables*:\n   * Accounts receivables have increased from $9.999 billion in Q4 2023 to $14.132 billion in Q2 2024. This is a significant increase and could indicate that NVDA is extending more credit to its customers, which might be a strategy to boost sales figures.\n3. *Inventory Levels*:\n   * Inventory levels have also increased from $5.282 billion in Q4 2023 to $6.675 billion in Q2 2024. This could be due to higher production in anticipation of future sales, but it also warrants monitoring to ensure it doesn\u2019t lead to excess unsold inventory.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWhile NVDA has shown strong revenue and net income growth, the significant increase in accounts receivables and inventory levels should be monitored closely. These increases could be normal business operations, but they could also indicate potential issues with cash flow or sales practices.

Once the AI training reaches an operational level, a lot of the compute will be handled on the edge. This will cause CAPEX to slow on building out AI training data centers. The end user is where the money is long term in AI. The best way to profit off of AI is to sell to consumers. One of the best platforms to do that is with AAPL. Since the majority of consumers will interface AI with handsets. AAPL has a 2 billion user base with iPhones and will be one of the aggregate locations for AI software to be hosted. iPhone sales is one thing but the revenue in services is another that will only increase. Other major players in this are META, MSFT, and GOOGL. Unfortunately these big moves you see in NVDA will eventually slow down. It will take one quarter of posting \u201cokay\u201d numbers to return NVDA to a cyclical semi stock, as competition in the semi space enters and CAPEX expenditure on GPU\u2019s slow from hyper-scalers. Funds will chase the next leg in the AI story which will be in profitable AI software. However, and this is TBD at the moment, if NVDA dominates the robotics compute that is another story. At the moment NVDA looks good through 2025 and mid 2026 and will be a good investment long term, but dominating the whole AI story is not a guarantee as this story broadens to other companies making profit from AI."}, {"author": "At_least_once1", "created": 1724439940.0, "text": "I\u2019m just worried I\u2019m too heavy on Tech.

It\u2019s a long answer, so bear (no pun intended) with me.\n\nLet's say you're a big tech company or a startup in 2023 and have seen Generative AI in action, realized its potential and wonder what it can do for you. So you want to train your own LLMs or if you're a cloud provider, host other enterprises that can then train their own LLMs. But there's a major hurdle - you need AI chips. Not just some. You need a f***ton of them - just to get started with your AI endeavors. And what is pretty much the only way to get these chips? Nvidia. So you start spending massively with Nvidia. You're not too happy about it, but you don't have a choice. Nvidia\u2019s revenues shoot up, and they enjoy wide margins and massive profitability. The rise to fame. This is where we are now.\n\nNow a few quarters have passed. You have got nearly enough chips to maintain a run-rate of your AI efforts. If you\u2019re one of the hyperscalers, in the meantime you\u2019ve also been ramping up production of your own chips (Amazon\u2019s Tranium, Google\u2019s TPUs, Microsoft\u2019s Maia and Cobalt), because even if your chips are worse than Nvidia\u2019s, they\u2019re much cheaper for you since you can skip the premium you pay for Nvidia GPUs. At this point, you are able to train the LLMs you want, because you have already accumulated the chips you needed to get started. Sure you\u2019ll need to replenish them some day, but that\u2019s gonna be a much slower rate than the initial buildout phase. Besides at this point, you have other problems such as sourcing power of the continual operation of the chips and maintaining them. This is the digestion phase. It will be the downfall of Nvidia\u2019s exponential growth and there will be some disillusionment here.\n\nThis is the gist of my bear case. There are a few common criticisms and nuances that I can address upfront:\n\nCompetition chips are not even remotely close to Nvidia\u2019s chips, especially because of the CUDA \u201cmoat\u201d that Nvidia enjoys. Well, it is true that Nvidia has dominance in the broader ecosystem, but the AI workload is very disproportionate where there are a few custom use-cases that rack up most of the requirement, and these are indeed going to move to custom chips, like Amazon is able to [use Trainium Chips to pre-train an LLM](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.10630v1), Google (this one should be plenty obvious) [used TPUs to train Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#:~:text=We%20trained%20Gemini%201.0%20at,our%20most%20efficient%20to%20serve.), [OpenLlama](https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama) and [Apple\u2019s Foundation LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21075) have also used Google\u2019s TPUs for training.\nBut bro, they\u2019re always going to continue to buy more chips and the latest chips, because AI is constantly evolving and it\u2019s a race. Yah, this is quite speculative. If you say that chips are really getting much better over time, then it could go either way (why would I buy something now rather than wait for the next generation). Also, relying on the race to continue forever is a folly. Sure there\u2019s a race now where everyone is accelerating, but wait until revenues continue to not materialize, and also add in point #1, and one day you\u2019re looking at a shift of focus away from AI spend acceleration, even if there is innovation still happening in the background. I\u2019m sure AI is going to stay relevant, it has been relevant before ChatGPT, but the infrastructure will already be there, so it\u2019s just gonna be everyday business."}, {"author": "Upswing5849", "created": 1723526374.0, "text": "Interesting. Thanks for sharing. A few questions:\n\n1. What about power efficiency? Blackwell chips, for instance, are not only substantially more powerful than Hopper, but ultimately are significantly cheaper to operate for the same compute as well. ASICs might be cheaper to product, but they also better be efficient enough to offset the cost. \n\n2. Researchers are using CUDA. How much will Meta or Apple need to pay in order to retrain their engineers to use their own software and dev tools? Are these employees going to have second thoughts about transferring to a new platform, especially if they're considering career changes in the future?\n\n3. Are you familiar with many of the node advancements that we are currently seeing on the leading edge or should see within a generation or two? (things like backside power delivery, bonded wafers, GAA, etc.? Again, the leading edge is not only more powerful but also more power efficient, so companies may be happy to pay a premium to Nvidia to realize these advancements and their benefits more quickly than trying to chase that leading edge with their own chips. \n\n4. What about the revenue *now*? I can understand buying puts at some point, but why now? Nvidia cannot meet the demand and the release of Blackwell will only drive more demand. (because again the hardware is not only more powerful but more efficient to run)\n\n5. The race between chip makers has been in full swing for many decades. Why would it stop any time soon? Especially with Moore's Law being no longer relevant, architecture and hardware design becomes even more important for squeezing out more performance and power efficiency. You think that companies will simply stop investing in R&D on the leading node at some point? Why would they?\n\nI think you make some good points, but how confident are you in your bear case? What would make you reevaluate?

Not sure if it\u2019s true, but I know that TPUs are built very specifically for AI use-cases... Also in my previous comment I linked that OpenLlama and Apple\u2019s models were trained on TPUs, so it may be true.\n\n2. Hmmm so Meta uses CUDA pretty heavily but I\u2019m not quite sure about Apple... There are two parts to this point: 1. \u201c... need to pay in order to retrain their engineers to use their own software and dev tools?\u201d Yeah, they\u2019ll probably have to bring up a new team or two that builds and maintains the internal framework and have the ML Engineers interface with the new team, while the researcher interfaces with the ML Engineers and remains mostly shielded from all this... If the new team is 20 people, we\u2019re looking at what like ~$10M / year.

This is more about what the market is pricing in vs not, as opposed to what is actually happening in terms of material revenues/earnings. In June/July the market value for Nvidia was the most disconnected from my fair value. The payout was very good if my thesis plays out over 2.5 years. Once the market already starts expecting a slump in revenue, even before the actual slump starts, the trade is already over (or the return is highly diminished). We already saw a preview of this with all the Capex talk and the same puts I bought in June are already 50% more expensive. Still, it\u2019s really tough to predict the top of a bubble. The disconnect could certainly extend even further, which is why I didn\u2019t buy as many puts as I wanted to.\n\n5. The \u201crace\u201d that I was talking about wasn\u2019t the race between chip-makers, but the race between chip-buyers to showcase their AI prowess. So this is not the same as what I was talking about?\n\nThis is one of the highest conviction investment theses of my lifetime.

And what about academic researchers and independent developers? Which frameworks/tools will they use if every company is making their own custom architecture?\n\nBroadly speaking, most researchers and engineers are not directly exposed to CUDA. The CUDA/hardware aspects are abstracted away by PyTorch or TensorFlow, which are hardware agnostic. Only the infrastructure engineers working on, let\u2019s say optimising the performance, are directly exposed. For most of these employees, switching between CUDA and a proprietary system will be akin to switching between C++ and Java, for example. It\u2019s not trivial, but it\u2019s in no way career-ending, or disqualifies you for a future employment role. [This](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/nvidiaopenaitritonpytorch) is a good read.\n\n> Is that the period of time when their forward PE was the lowest its been in many, many years?\n\nAhh, good ol\u2019 forward PE... My fair value didn\u2019t change after the earnings report, but apparently the market\u2019s expectation of growth amplified (because it\u2019s expecting plain exponential growth). This created a higher disconnect between my fair value and the market valuation, and the odds were ever more in my favor to go short.\n\n> Let me get this straight... You bought puts without any clear picture as to when the stock make its ATH and decline?\n\nIt\u2019s always the case though, isn\u2019t it.. If you\u2019re going long an individual stock, you believe it\u2019s undervalued, but how do you know when the market will correct itself, if ever? Also, you don\u2019t know if it will decline further. In fact, oftentimes it does and famous value investors always talk about this. It\u2019s just that with going long, more time is on your side... On the short side there is more risk and erosion over time, and I calculated my risk-reward below and sized my position accordingly.\n\n> So are you saying that the AI products that these companies are building won't yield revenue or profits? When do you expect companies to figure that out and abandon ship? If companies abandon ship, do they risk losing to competitors who stuck with their AI projects?\n\nI think some of them will profit, I see some directions have opened: 1. Creative (Content Generation). 2. Automated low-level reasoning (customer service, summarization). 3. Repeated reasoning (Education, Coding Copilots). However, it will be a small minority of the vast number of experimental projects that are going on, and this is to be expected with any new breakthrough technology.\n\nBy the way as I explained in my original comment, the success of AI projects is not at all at odds with my thesis. The chip sales are part of the initial buildout phase, i.e. are needed to even get started with the AI projects (training the LLM). The maintenance / run-rate of chip buys needed will be much lower once the infrastructure is in place, and the AI projects can keep going on. Also, for inference, the cost-benefit is much more in favor of ASICs, compared to Nvidia\u2019s for training.\n\n> You don't even seem to know much about TSMC and what's happening on the leading edge.\n\n(things like backside power delivery, bonded wafers, GAA) This is a valid criticism. To be fair though, then you should also research what the competition is doing in this area. Do you have reason to believe that only Nvidia/TSMC are innovating here?\n\n> You also don't seem to have actually crunched the financials to understand what the company is worth.\n\nI did, and did a terrible job at posting them on reddit, my DCF is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/s/qvonRFeziF) and reverse DCF is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/s/F3Q47GrA7w). You will obviously not agree with my valuations (otherwise you\u2019d be bearish too), but yeah I certainly wouldn\u2019t have this level of conviction without both the story and the numbers solidly falling into place. Also, you can ask all kinds of questions like why is my decline to $80B/year run-rate revenue and not $60B/year or $100B/year, so yeah some of that is arbitrary, but realistic, and is far far better than people over here just floating entirely arbitrary share prices without any financial valuation whatsoever.\n\nI also from time-to-time repeat the same calculation - in what world do I see Nvidia\u2019s future cash flows discounted to today summing up to $2.5T, and honestly, I don\u2019t see one. If I start seeing one, I might sell out of my puts.\n\n> You do realize that between now and 2029, there are probably hundreds and hundreds of opportunities to buy puts on companies that are headed towards the shitter, or plenty of other options strategies to support both bullish and bearish positions on... again... thousands and thousands of stocks.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re able to identify these opportunities... I\u2019m not. Feel free to send me trade tips \ud83d\ude42If these strategies are so obvious, most of the time they\u2019re priced accordingly by the market, or outside my circle of competence, where I cannot build the conviction.. Here I\u2019m seeing a major disconnect in the market, where some (rightful) enthusiasm has extended several times over. I mostly glance over stocks\u2019 financials, and if nothing is obviously wrong to me, I move along. Nvidia already had my attention for months before I started looking into it deeply. It\u2019s possible that another opportunity comes along, and if so, I have spare change for it as well.\n\n> Why on Earth would you dedicate yourself to buying and holding puts against Nvidia starting in June 2024 and ending in 2029?\n\nYou mock the long wait, but let me show you some calculations. I bought the $40 NVDA puts for Dec 2026 for $1.7 / contract. If my target price of $25 is reached by Dec 2026, that\u2019s a payout of $15 / contract (minus the premium). It is 7.8x my money in 2.5 years. Not too bad I think. Actually, if I have to go the 2029 route and it has a probability of 0.75 to be successful, assuming the next put contract price remains the same, that is a yield of (0.75\\*15 - 2\\*1.7)/(2\\*1.7) = 2.3 or 130%, in other words 2.3^0.2 = 1.18 or 18% annualized. That\u2019s market-beating returns. Just trying to show how the strategy makes sense given that I\u2019m this bearish (of-course you will think my $25 price target is ridiculous beyond wildest dreams, but just for the sake of the trade, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a given, then such is the calculation).\n\n> Nvidia has a long track record of success and the leadership at the company is among the best in the industry.

Or it could turn out that AI is not as big as expected, or maybe a competitor shows up earlier than expected, bringing the margins down.\n\nAs a result, the range of projections for Nvidia is insanely wide. If you look at the analyst price targets on Yahoo Finance, you'll see that the low end is $50.30 and the high end is $200. The high end is 300% higher than the low end!\n\nCompare that to an established \"boring\" old company where the outlook is much more predictable, e.g. Coca-Cola (KO). Low end is $65, high end is $76, that's only 17% higher.\n\nNow because the range of projections for Nvidia is so wide, any tiny bit of information, as insignificant it might seem, can throw the market's projection all over the place.

Increasing interest on Japans end killed the profit making ability of this strategy, and the US not raising the interest rates basically reversed the money flow. This required alot of companies to pull out quick and hard to avoid going into debt. Because a sharp drop other companies and individual traders also pulled out. \n\nIf you heard other reasoning, it doesn't mean it's less true. This is just a primary trigger.

Haven't see any others...."}, {"author": "redditissocoolyoyo", "created": 1723402787.0, "text": "To determine if this valuation and the assumptions behind it are realistic, we need to consider several factors:\n\n### 1. **Growth Rates:**\n   - **Scenario 1 (Worst Case):** 15% growth for the next 5 years and 10% for the following 5 years might be conservative, considering NVIDIA's historical growth rates, especially in the context of its dominance in the AI and semiconductor space. However, it's not implausible if we assume market saturation, increased competition, or macroeconomic challenges.\n   - **Scenario 2 (Best Case):** 25% growth for the next 5 years and 20% for the following 5 years are optimistic but possible, especially if NVIDIA continues to dominate emerging markets like AI, data centers, and autonomous vehicles. These rates suggest strong belief in continued innovation and market expansion.\n   - **Scenario 3 (Normal Case):** 25% growth for the next 5 years and 12% for the following 5 years seem to strike a balance between optimism and realism. This might be considered a reasonable estimate assuming continued growth but accounting for some market maturation over time.\n\n### 2. **Discount Rate:**\n   - An 8% discount rate is commonly used in DCF analyses for large, established companies. It reflects the opportunity cost of capital and the risk associated with the company's cash flows. For NVIDIA, 8% seems reasonable, but some might argue for a slightly higher rate given the volatility in the tech sector.\n\n### 3. **Terminal Value:**\n   - **Terminal Growth Rate and Multiple:**\n     - The terminal growth rate reflects the expected long-term growth of the company after the projection period. The rates used (ranging from 2% to 10%) seem within a reasonable range.\n     - The terminal multiples (ranging from 30 to 45) are higher-end but might be justified if NVIDIA continues to grow and maintain its leadership in high-growth markets. However, multiples in this range assume strong long-term performance and a favorable economic environment.\n\n### 4. **Intrinsic Value and Implied Share Price:**\n   - The implied share prices of $141.28 (worst case) to $398.73 (best case) encompass a wide range. The weighted average price of $263.14 falls within the mid-range, aligning reasonably well with the market's expectations given current valuations.\n   - Whether these figures are realistic depends on whether the growth assumptions are met. NVIDIA's current market price is likely reflective of a strong growth outlook, so the best-case scenario might align with more bullish market expectations, while the worst case could align with a more pessimistic view if growth falters.\n\n### 5. **External Market Factors:**\n   - Consider the broader market environment, competition, technological advancements, and potential regulatory challenges. These factors could significantly impact NVIDIA's future performance and, therefore, the realism of these projections.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Realism:** The analysis presents a wide range of possible outcomes, which is good practice in valuation.

Search Revenue: $225 Bn \n   1. AI will generate answers (with sources) that will replace links on search results. Shift from quantity to quality. Understand that it will disrupt the current agreements with content creators\n2. Cloud revenue: $300 Bn, 20% CAGR\n   1. Data centres have a trillion dollars of capex, which now has to be replaced with newer chips. Amazon's CEO mentioned that only 10% of infrastructure is on cloud, and they see continued growth\n3. Productivity gains: $460 Bn\n   1. Fortune 500 companies have a revenue of $41 trillion, with about 15-20% in wage bills. AI is expected to increase productivity by about 25%. Even if we assume 15% productivity improvement and that 50% of revenue flows to productivity enablers, this is about 460 billion (41\\*15%\\*15%\\*50%)\n4. Other use-cases: $x bn\n   1. Mobile devices: Apple Intelligence to go mainstream on 1 billion+ devices\n   2. Palantir is showing sharp increase in revenue\n   3. Software like Grammarly etc are now available in every device\n\nOverall, I think annual AI revenue stream is about $900 bn, 10-15% CAGR. it has been theorised that for every $1 in AI revenue, about $0.25 will flow to\u00a0[AI chip companies](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/).\n\nSo, I expect Nvidia to have a steady annual revenue stream of about $200 billion (80% market share), which will be front-loaded (even $250-300 billion over the next few years) because the capacity either doesn\u2019t exist or has to be replaced. Stead state net income of about $150 billion\n\n**Assuming a multiple of 30-35 (on par with MS, Apple), I would expect Nvidia to trade at about 4.5-5 trillion, which equates to a price of 180-220.**\n\nFew takeaways:\n\n1.

Parallel computing is not a sudden development. This revolution has been underway ever since CPUs first went multi-core 2 decades ago, and even before that too. It's part to due with Moore's Law coming to an end. In order to improve chips and compute at this point, we need new ways of approaching software and hardware integration. What Nvidia has apparently achieved with Blackwell is very impressive on this front, including the memory busses between discrete GPUs, or so-called interconnects. \n\nA lot of people on this sub don't seem to understand much about the hardware and software developments happening in real time behind the scenes. They're just seen or heard about ChatGPT and that Nvidia has been going up a lot. And a lot of people think it's gotta come down just because it's gone up so much. \n\nBut when you actually project forward into the future, the map looks quite good for Nvidia. (and a host of other companies) Machine learning and deep learning has already been useful for a long while and these new generation of chips just unlock a whole new level of potential use cases and new AI designs. \n\nWill the price go down? Yeah, it certainly could. Black swans or grey swans could drag nvidia down or make it go sideways long enough for competitors to catch up. But the barriers of entry to this industry are stark and most other companies do not have the type of hardware and software setup that Nvidia offers. Compare them to Apple with Apple's walled garden and ecosystem. Nvidia has that type of moat, at least for the time being.\n\nAlso, I don't know what you're talking about but Nvidia has been around longer than Meta, Google and Amazon.

CONY dividends dropped pretty far after the big dip but still paying $1 per share.  MSTY went from 2.332 to 1.94 per share. These are my main two.  I will see how Sept. goes and if things don't return to normal, I may sell CONY all or in part.   I will then invest in QQQY which still looks pretty stable even after this last disappointment.  Their dividends pay 2.50026 per share which is good as you can see and there was no change even after this current dip.  My mentor advised me of QQQY but I had already invested most $ in MSTY and CONY.   \n\nI plan on keeping NVIDIA stocks NVDA and NVDY because I believe they will rebound in the near future.  Other stocks I am watching that paid good dividends are JNJ 1.24 per share (Johnson and Johnson) and JEPY  (JP Morgan JEPY Defiance S&P 500 Enhanced Option Income ETF ) 1.67 dividend est. currently. Also, YBTC Roundhill ETF Trust Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF current dividend 2.0622 per share.  I researched the dividends on over 100 stocks but I suggest you do your own research especially since many stocks have taken a dive.\n\nI am not a stock broker or finance manager of any kind.  I am not an advisor.  These stocks are just what I invest in or am interested in for future investments.  These are not suggestions but they are some of which my mentor and I are investing in. \n\nThe apps I use are **Robinhood**, they are good to begin  with and good if you don't have or want a financial advisor or have a small amount to invest.  When my portfolio reaches a certain amount, I may move over to J.P. Morgan, Fidelity or Charles Schwab. \n\nI also use **Market Chameleon**.  They have lots of info and history on stocks, graphs and upper right corner of the page you will find the Estimated dividends for income stocks coming up for the next month or quarter or year.  My dividends did not change until this month. \n\nIn my opinion, it is good that you haven't much to invest.  This will be a good time to research and learn what you can before choosing your investing path. I don't know anything about other types of investments, I am only interested in the income stocks presently.  I suggest watching your stocks everyday to see how they move so you can get used to the peaks and valleys.  It is no guarantee but you may learn a lot about a particular stock.

You need special leadership to have lots of SW engineer installed, lots of research (300 PhD) invested to in to technology/products which aren't your core business (HW gaming GPUs). \n\nNvidia's investment in CUDA, the AI platform, buying Mellanox has been funded by gaming. Gaming made Nvidia big and Jensen made a bet on it 30 years ago. But later he used gaming funding for another bet in accelerated computing. That needs conviction and strong leadership since Jensen was convinced of the idea upon founding but he had to convice every Nvidia employee that it's the right way to go with CUDA and use a lot resources for it despite having strong competition in gaming back then.\n\nYou have to understand that the DGX-1 system for ML with V100 is 7 years old now. The first GPU HPC with Nvidia was installed like \\~13 years ago. People think that Nvidia became \"suddenly\" successful but that is total BS. Nvidia has been on this track for a long time. While others try now to compete at the 24hrs race of AI, Nvidia is on the 24 years mission into the future. \n\nAnd Nvidia takes it's time, see Omniverse was presented actually 4 years ago:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o\\_XeGyg2NIo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_XeGyg2NIo)\n\nInstead of rushing it, Nvidia is slowly nurturing it just like they have done with the AI platform. Improving it every generation to make it as great as it is today. Likewise Nvidia is working with a lot of patient and focus on many solutions for years. Like their self driving system is 7 years in the making. Their robotics stuff isn't new at all. Don't expect any fast releases because Nvidia rather refines before they release but by the time they release, they will surprise and be without competition. The basic rule of Jensen here is to work on very hard problems nobody else tackles. Hard problems take time to solve but once solved you'll instantly become the market leader since you basically created the market yourself.\n\nAnd finally, Nvidia is the best at marketing. So many companies ignore how important marketing is. Jensen is the king at this and does the best job there is. He is also an engineer so he is unique in a way that he can combine marketing while also using a lot of tech speak but simplified. Many don't like him for that because he seems like the sales guy with the vacuum cleaner knocking on your door but the CEO must be the #1 promoter of a company and its' products. And as I said, nobody beats Jensen at that.\n\nTherefore, Nvidia's success isn't their current product line. No, they are just the results of leadership and company culture of the past decades. As long as these remain, the company will remain one of the best there is. For sure, there will be cycles in revenue as there have been in the past, the same for the stock but if you want to invest in future solutions then invest in Jensen and his team because Jensen is the only guy in the world, ready to bet a trillion dollar market cap on new ideas while cannabilizing his own products\\*.\n\n\\*his very own teaching:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn1EsFe7snQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn1EsFe7snQ)"}, {"author": "Fiftyfivepunchman", "created": 1722644684.0, "text": "Buy a long dated put.

No.\n\nChatGPT, and all of these other current \"AI\" systems in the world (Google Gemini, Meta AI, and etc.) are all just very polished traditional computing systems with fancy data-models and algorithms. GPT is stupid; literally, it's stupid. It makes frequent mistakes, you have to repeat yourself and constantly ask it to do any type of complex task (especially coding). Everything that is says, does, and writes to you is based off of data models it was trained with. It's ability to code and answers are really just a collective input of data, largely from the internet. Dare I say, GPT and other AI are just a glorified \"Google\" engine. Instead of Googling, it pieces things together things you ask of it, whether it's to generate a picture, write a novel, or some code.\n\nGPT is not actually artificial intelligence, or sentient. We're decades away from true AI. I do feel eventually the hype around AI is going to slow down some. I feel NVDA is still a great investment, because their technology is (literally) years ahead of the competition, and there's still some ground to make with this tech.

For the past 10 years working almost exclusively on various ML products in big tech companies (think meta, google, twitter). My job requires technical aptitude, so i'm not a marketing type and can see through the usual sales hype. I also understand the evolution of these types of products (s curve). At the same time my job also requires me to understand adoption cycles, how to commercialize technologies and to develop some sense for what markets are willing to pay for or not.\n\nAs far as how i got to the valuation. I took three different approaches and they all triangulated to $168 in next 12 months\n\n1. DCF model for the company using my growth assumptions based on what i've seen in the industry\n2. Estimating total AI spend and attributing how much of that will go to NVDA over the next 5 years. What i did here was list the top use cases for GPUs (beyond just LLMs) across 10 different sectors, to try to size the total spend in the AI market. I then broke that down as how i expect it to be allocated across the value chain from software costs, to operations, ML engineers, servers....etc and of course chips. I then further adjusted with assumptions on % market share that NVDA can capture within its segment of the value chain. This gives me potential total projected revenues that NVDA would earn that i then cross-refernced with 5yr revene projections from #1 above\n3. The last method is very crude but was more of a sanity check step, which is basically taking the total spend globally and calculating it as a percent of total global GDP just to see if it makes sense (i.e not too large) and it was indeed very reasonable in low single digit percentage.\n\nI have a low/high value but i don't believe in caveated forecasts, my philosophy is a forecast is one figure that encapsulates total risk.\n\nFinally i will say in a lot of my estimations i took a conservative approach where i estimated AI spend that would be paid for by cost savings alone, i didn't even factor too much innovation and new use cases unlocked that would open up new markets. I'm confident that those will come along but not in the next year.\n\nI'm fairly confident in my estimate, but keep in mind nothing is ever 100%. And a recession could drastically influence this as it would impact overall spend. Also histroically this stock has had 40% volatility regularly, even when it was in single digit dollars per share, and it will certainly continue to do so. As of right now i think it's extremely unlikely for it to drop below 80, but it is possible. If there is a miss the market will overreact, if there is geopolitical threat the market will overreact. The antitrust stuff i'm not worried about at all, these companies always navigate those issues with very minimal impact when looking at medium and long term.\n\nMy best guess is next earnings is going to be good, after that there might be 1 or maybe 2 earnings that might relatively dissapoint, and then up from there. This is based on the the timing i think it'll take for users to start showing the type of results they are getting from their AI related spend. They won't be fully baked in time but will be directionally clear enough to give reassurance."}, {"author": "Specialist-Scene9391", "created": 1722666063.0, "text": "Ok lets see what happen!"}, {"author": "Aromatic-Note6452", "created": 1722728324.0, "text": "This.

The system of right and wrong can change daily and theres no actual moral reasponsibility to do otherwise and with that there is no consequence and therefore your motivation to do good or evil is at will. Sure you can do good in your own eyes for your own reasons, but you have no right to demand your fellow man to do good and no reason to feel poorly when you or they dont do good.  Because why should they unless it benefit them?  Good and evil is meaningless with no God.  You can temporarily repeat statements of \"just be a good person\" but the further society gets from a society that still loosely obeys that absolute standard for which to compare itself to, the further that idea will look silly.\n\nPeople in society only do good because they believe they should and modern \"good\" is very loosely defined and has been hanging off the laurels of Christian Ideals for centuries.

I would say there is 3 levels of understanding, please try to go through them if you want to use leverage ETFs and don\u2019t listen to what people keep repeating without having fully understood what they\u2019re saying. There is too much monkey see monkey do for something that you need to build your own understanding on. Don\u2019t even take my word for it, but if you do want my suggestion (not financial advice) I\u2019ll offer one at the end \n\nLevel 1: if a stock goes up then 2x, 3x is even better so why not buy the leveraged version \n\nLevel 2: this is where you have the \u201cvolatility decay\u201d crowd comes in and perhaps well intentioned but cluelessly deriding these instruments as \u201cday trading only\u201d and making it seem like your investment is going to evaporate overnight. Most people get stuck here and never graduate \n\nLevel 3: The real truth about how these instruments perform. Thankfully there is a lot of great well researched and academic-like depth papers on the topic and a range of historic data and tools you can use to understand if these can be held long term, which yes they absolutely can and offer outsized returns. But also yes the risk of decay is high. \n\nThe biggest variables that determine your net levered performance are\n\n1) what leverage multiplier you go for\n2) when you buy \n3) the volatility of the underlying \n\nIf we take one of the worst and extreme examples \n\nIf you bought QQQ, a tech heavy index, at the top of the dotcom it would have recovered by now \n\nIf you bought QLD, which is 2x QQQ at the same exact time it would have recovered to slightly below QQQ today \n\nAnd if you bought TQQQ, which is 3x QQQ at the same time then it would still have not recovered till today\n\nSo yes the \u201cdecay\u201d is real. But there are also thousands of periods I can sample where you could hold any of those leveraged ETFs for months and years and come out way way ahead of the baseline, by a ridiculous measure. \n\nSo there is no inherent thing that says you can\u2019t hold those long term. The reality is nuanced, and the best teacher here is data. Again there is papers on the topic and you could do your own testing as well \n\nThe tl:dr is, on a long term basis, a 2x leverage on Spy and Nasdaq performed the best on the frontier when comparing 1x,2x,3x and 4x. I know there is also similar studies done on the Dow, Nikkei, Australian stock market and a couple others but I haven\u2019t looked into thosez\n\nFor most instruments with that level of volatility a 2x leverage is long term higher returns. But do not underestimate the psychological aspect of going through a 90% drawdown compared to a 45% drawdown tor example. So even if the return numbers on 2x work fine, the psychology aspect is another higher risk. It\u2019s easier to say you can stomach it and sit through it, it\u2019s a whole other thing seeing it happen and most people overestimate their confidence in being able to sit through that. Even when you position size, and put only what you can \u201cafford to lose\u201d a 90% drawdown WILL eat at you. \n\nAt 3x leverage avoid those for long term \n\nFinally, if a stock\u2019s weekly volatility within 2 standard deviations is in the order of 10%, know that you will eat a lot of shit even with 2x leverage\n\nTo make this all more relevant to the topic on hand, for most time periods and a long enough period if you bought and held NVDA vs NVDL the 2x leverage would have netted you orders of magnitude ahead.

We see the 2x in the ETF details so that helps it be straightforward on the gains, but you also have to understand that maintenance is taking a chunk of your gains. 1.5% doesn't sound like a lot, but what if you buy in to the stock and it just happens to go flat for your average across the time you are invested?  Now you have no gains and owe 1.57% of your capital to the managing company if you held it for a year. \n\nIt's peanuts in the day to day of course, but let's say you held NVDL and NVDA in equal amounts for the year. $1000 per stock, assume a 10% gain for both.\n\nNVDA= $1000*0.10 = 1010\nNVDL= $1000*0.10(\u00d72) = 1020 - 10.57 = 1009.43\n\nThat 10.57 is the maintenance cost (0.0157*1000)\n\nThis example is using a generous gain, slightly beating the market average. And you still lose against just holding the base stock itself across that time. \n\nOBVIOUSLY NVDA is no ordinary stock so depending where you got in this could very well be much higher in gains. But since none of us can predict the future there is no saying that it will continue to go to the moon as it has in past quarters. This is merely an example to understand how it works. \n\nLastly, consider an example where you don't make a profit and either go even or (gasp) a loss. \n\nTl;dr don't invest in leveraged stocks like NVDL long term.

No doubt it'll spike well north of that temporarily, but it won't be sustained.\n\nThere is excitement around NVDA, with good reason, but serious investors are going to be pragmatic. There are going to be plenty of opportunists jumping on the AI bandwagon, pumping in relatively small amounts of cash and hoping to make short-term gains on based on Nvidia's performance over the past 24 months, but I feel that the big investors are beginning to sober up and realise that the end-users of these AI chips are yet to turn their hardware into long-term financially sustainable products/services. If that continues, and Alphabet/Meta/Microsoft/etc decide to reduce their AI spending, then I don't see Nvidia's short term value increasing significantly over the next 12-24 months. Certainly not to the degree it has increased over the previous 12-24.\n\n  \nIn my opinion, Nvidia's true breakthrough product is going to be Geforce Now. They've already announced a 10 year partnership with Microsoft: ([Microsoft integrates Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now into its Xbox game pages - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200819/microsoft-nvidia-geforce-now-integration-xbox-store-pages)). Microsoft have also all but confirmed that they're all but moving away from console R&D and instead focusing on becoming a Publisher/Studio: ([Xbox going third-party and stepping away from hardware, says insider (gamingbible.com)](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/xbox/xbox-going-third-party-stepping-away-hardware-insider-633710-20240205).  \nNvidia and Microsoft have already laid the groundwork for a Netflix-style 'Games on Demand' service by making their Game Pass library available via Geforce Now: ([Microsoft Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard games on GeForce NOW. | NVIDIA (custhelp.com)](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5462/~/microsoft-xbox-game-studios%2C-bethesda%2C-and-activision-blizzard-games-on-geforce#:~:text=GeForce%20NOW%20supports%20Xbox%20PC,been%20released%20on%20GeForce%20NOW.). Technically all that needs to be done is to release an affordable, user-friendly Xbox-style Geforce Now streaming box 'console' for the home and significantly increase server-side capacity to cope with an increase in demand.  \nGeforce Now is still largely under the radar, especially for the majority of console gamers, but it has been proven to be a legitimate, cost-effective alternative to owning a high-end gaming PC: ([GeForce Now 4080: The Cloud Experience](https://youtu.be/cSq2WoARtyM?t=762&si=hC6k2axlkIgdsRym)) and gives users console-beating cost-effective on-demand access to their libraries anywhere that they have a broadband connection.\n\nI suspect that Nvidia and Microsoft are set to revolutionise the way people play games in exactly the same way as Netflix revolutionised the way we watch Movies and TV. Traditional consoles and gaming PC's will go the way of DVD and Blu-ray players, with only the enthusiast market opting to have a purpose-built, bespoke games machine in their homes. 95%+ of consumers will opt for affordable, integrated/set-top streaming options instead. That's when Nvidia's (and Microsoft's) value is *really* going to blow up.\n\nAnd I haven't even touched on what the same partnership could mean for enterprise level cloud computing, with Microsoft already offering a viable cloud-based Microsoft 365 Office suite.\n\nApologies for the essay, but I just wanted to put out there why I feel that the current excitement around NVDA is somewhat missing the mark. They're so much more than AI, and their earnings over the next 5-10 years are going to utterly eclipse what they can potentially achieve in the next 12 months.

It takes a lot discipline and faith in your analysis to stay the course during those times (assuming you had an analysis to begin with).\n\nIt would not take a lot to turn the short term sentiment post earnings to sour.

If the narrative and sentiment of AI stays the same I will then look to buy the stock back when it eventually takes a giant dump like it always does a month before earnings or so. \n\nThis stock is insanely volatile and there always seems to be some giant dip by 20-30% every quarter. People acting like Nvidia is never going to run out of steam aren't realistic. These big hyperscalers aren't going to keep buying GPUs in the bulk they are for 5+ years unless some huge ROI comes to fruition. It's still early where expectations on ROI should be very low and Wall St already wants some massive ROI to justify spending. No one truly knows how AI is going to play out or how long it takes to play out.\n\nI do think it's the next big tech innovation but it might take 15-20 years to see most of it's potential. Eventually we're going to reach a point where these big hyperscalers are good with the computing power they have and spending is going to slow down due to diminishing returns. Power consumption is eventually going to become a problem and that hasn't really been addressed at all. Even with improvements to power efficiency it's still going to rapidly outpace what power grids can support. \n\nThere are also a bunch of other macro economic factors that play into the price of not only this stock but the market. Sentiment is also insanely important on Wall St and this stock is mostly propped up by institutions. Get enough institutions that get cold feet about this stock and shit comes crashing down. Wall St constantly seems to need some sort of assurance that AI is here to stay. Doesn't matter if AI turns out to be the greatest thing since sliced bread if Wall St doesn't think so and constantly does mass sell offs tanking the stock. The stock has had a nice rebound but going from 140 to 90 in a few weeks is pretty insane and definitely leaves you uneasy. Feels more like gambling with Wall St sentiment than investing at this point. \n\nI'm going to continue to hold but if it hits 135-140+ again I most likely sell off and look to reenter when it shits itself again. I'll keep playing the game until we eventually get that quarter that misses or forward guidance is bad.

Never put more $$$ into investing something you cannot afford to lose. It\u2019s an investment, it\u2019s not a bank interest that guarantees a return. There is always risk. \n\n2. Never put 100% of your life savings into a single investment, whether it\u2019s stock/bond/real estate. Only invest the $$$ that you set aside after all your monthly expenses/emergency funds are fully accounted for. \n\n3. Learn the difference between investing vs gambling. Just because everyone put $$$ into a certain company and thus you do the same is not investing. You need to do your own research into such company before handing out your $$$. If you hand out $$$ and don\u2019t know why you hand out $$$ and the stock fluctuates in the short term, you panic and regret your decision, that\u2019s gambling. Why ? Because you put $$$ into a stock expecting it to go up to take profits without knowing anything about the company you invest into. That\u2019s no difference than playing in a casino.\n\n4. Do research on the company you invest, the more $$$ you put into it, the better your knowledge of that company better be: sales, revenues, profit margins, product cycle, how relevant the products of said company are, what are the trends, are they becoming vitals to other companies/businesses/consumers? What about now vs future implications etc. Do all those research once, twice, as many times as needed so that once you put your $$$ into it, you won\u2019t worry about short term fluctuations because you know the company will grow in the long term, and its price will reflect that accordingly."}, {"author": "Peshmerga_Sistani", "created": 1725035612.0, "text": "The company reported 30b in revenue for Q2, +15% quarter over quarter.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNVDA guided down this earnings report for Q3, at +8% QoQ, 32b.\u00a0 Even though the revenue is increasing, the rate at which it is growing is slowing.\u00a0 15% to 8% from one quarter to the next."}, {"author": "First-Bowl3212", "created": 1725035208.0, "text": "What do you guys think?\nI invested 30k in NVDA, down -18%.

The reason why NVDA stock blew up back from $92, cuz there the normal summer market sell off and people saw extreme value at that price point and imo anything before $120 is value. \n\nAlso as an example, Tesla. That stock has no business trading at $220. It should be around $140-$150 at best and really imo around $50-$60. As they\u2019ve missed their last 4 earnings calls, their market share is shrinking, profits are down, and Elmo gone full racist maga. On top of that, the dumbass shareholder what to give this clown $60 billion for destroying Tesla and they haven\u2019t come out with a significant product in 4-5 years except the CybeDump.  Yet how do you price in all this bad news and then Elmo comes out that FSD vehicles are coming soon (probably 2069) and his Stans drive up the stock by 80-100 points in a month?

This is because market forces, like supply and demand, ultimately determine stock prices.\n\nIf investors continue to buy shares, the price can still rise, regardless of the market cap.\n\nYou're not taking into account that the slow down with Apple is because the cell phone and tablet markets were reaching closer to saturation. Therefore, not as much growth. However, Ai has not hit saturation, and market cap is simply a calculation.\n\nThe Ai market is still increasing. When it begins to saturate we will see a similar decline, but how many years until Ai meets saturation is another story. It takes a very long time to supply so much of the world with new supercomputers, and on average it's 2-5 years before they purchase hardware upgrades.

In a couple of months I might have to start withdraw some of the money I invested, and I would like to recover some losses I had last month before I have to pull my money off of it. So I end up wondering how much it can go up and down after earnings.\n\nAs I mentioned in other responses, I have no doubts NVDA will close this year higher than what it is now, and next year will be higher, and so on, but it cannot be a straight line up, it has to go up and down.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot have my money invested for more than a few months if I cannot generate more money out of it to reinvest. In 2-3 months I will likely have to start taking portions of what I invested, which leaves me with smaller investing sample, and therefore, smaller potential for generating gains. I just want to stay on the game, and for that, I need to make a certain amount of money during these 2 months. That said, I might go extremely bullish on leverage EFTs for the earnings, because even though the loss potential is higher, I'm gonna have to opt out of the game soon if I can really achieve the gain goals I have to.\n\nMight sound like despair, but its actually me just accepting the chance of losing money in order to make money, and if I lose it, it's gonna be gained experience and I'll deal with that, but I just want to stay and truly understand the game, and be able to improve my financial life while learning."}, {"author": "ceramicatan", "created": 1724463214.0, "text": "As bullish as I am about Nvidia, I have to make a comment regarding Tesla.

It\u2019s definitely a big flush down the toilet.\n\nKamala Harris as VP cast the deciding vote for the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan in the Senate in March 2021. Even prominent economists associated with liberal politics and the Democratic Party like Larry Summers and Olivier Blanchard had warned that the American Rescue Plan could cause significant inflation. Summers called it the \u201cleast responsible\u201d economic policy in 40 years, arguing that it would push demand beyond the capacity of the economy and lead to sustained inflation. Similarly, Blanchard expressed concerns that the scale of the spending would create significant inflationary pressures, potentially harming economic stability in the long run. Those warnings proved prescient. Shortly after Harris cast her vote securing passage in the Senate of one of the largest increases in deficit spending in a generation, long-dormant inflation arose across the U.S. economy and pushed inflation to levels not seen in decades. By the following summer, inflation peaked at nine percent, the fastest pace of price increases since 1981.

This is because market forces, like supply and demand, ultimately determine stock prices.\n\nIf investors continue to buy shares, the price can still rise, regardless of the market cap.\n\nLast year \"Simply Wall St\" (and others) were talking about how they didn't expect an 11% increase from Apple this year, because everyone has a cell phone now. The cell phone \"market\" has met \"saturation\". To continue substantial growth, apple will have to continue to venture out beyond phones, tablets, and VR. NVidia is in another ballpark all together. The AI market is on the other end of the spectrum. They are nowhere near saturation.

You can make an educated guess and increase your chances of success, but that's it.\n\nThe thing about short term trading is that stocks tend to be very volatile in the short term, meaning chances of success are lower. Chance of success in short term trading, even when making some good analysis, are almost as low as sports gambling. You can make a lot of money, but you can lose it all just as easily. High risk, high reward, a good strategy for those that have a good salary and can throw some money in their trash bin. No matter how good you are, you need the luck element.\n\nLong term trading on the other hand, has a much higher chance of success, like waaay higher, than short term trading. Good for those of us who have a low salary and do not feel good about losing a lot of the very hard earned money.\n\nAlso, holding is not a strategy, it is just the basics of long term investing. There are multiple long term trading strategies, one of the most famous  one is focusing on dollar cost averaging. Another common strategy of long term investing is to buy and forget, a different strategy than the dollar cost averaging that works differently and many investors try, especially those that are investing for retirement.\n\nIs long term trading the \"default' as you say? Absolutely not. Most investors trade short term, thats why  90% of investors are not able to profit from the stock market. \n\nMost investors sell when they see their stock in the red and panic.That is short term trading. Holding for 2-4 years is also short term investing. Long term is anything  that is hold for 5 or more years.\n\nMany millionares have made their fortunes with just long term trading.

Whereas NVDA is traded extremely frequently, you can look up the trading volume yourself. If you search on Google, 5Y ROI for VOO is close to 100% whereas NVDA is 3000%. Can NVDA crash tomorrow, sure and if u put 100% in it, ur boned. Whereas with VOO, highly doubt all the companies in it crash on the same day. Speaking of which, NVDA earning is out on the 28th and so maybe u want to cash in lol.\n\nRegarding lump sum or DCA, unless you have insider info, no way to tell when the stock goes up or down. For NVDA, right now it's good to do a lump sump bc of the earning report. For VOO, you can also do the same because the price changes is too little by the week or month."}, {"author": "3VRMS", "created": 1723958581.0, "text": "Nobody knows if it's gonna be a bear market or bull. Fear news always says we're headed into a bear market. It gets your clicks.\n\nI can say I'm seeing plenty of \"news\" that says we're heading to the biggest bull market in history. Either way, I'd trust a fortune teller reading my palm more.\n\nJust put your money mostly into VOO, VT or whatever low cost broad ETF, and a small amount into NVDA. The small amount being the one you can lose 90% and be fine with it, and chill. Over that long of a time frame, don't invest too much into any one single company. You never know what could happen, they could collapse immensely and even go bankrupt. Just ask that poor Intel investor after getting grandma's money.\n\nMost top companies don't stay up there for long, and the turn around rate is getting faster every year. Look at the top S&P 500 from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago vs today. How many do you recognize? How many were unstoppable international monsters back in the day, only to be replaced by a new company that's only existed for a few years?\n\nAlso, timing the market to maximize gains is a fool's errand. You're betting on luck, so don't ask for logical reasons to support good or bad luck.

You cannot look at a car that has two doors and simply say \"because it has two doors it is competing with this other car because it also has two doors\". The mustang competes with the Camaro, but the mustang does not compete with the Corvette, and the Camaro does not compete with the Corvette. Likewise, the Corvette was not built to compete with the Ford GT, and even though an AMG Mercedes is built to compete with an M series BMW, they still appeal to different types of people, because it isn't all about the power. It's also about the suspension, the interior, how the steering feels etc. \n\nWhether or not a vehicle has the same amount of doors, is an SUV, sedan, coupe etc. does not mean they are direct competitors. In the semiconductor world, these companies are not trying to give direct competition. They are being \"tailored\" for certain tasks. The closest competitor you're going to find Nvidia is AMD, in the all encompassing form, but no 2 GPUs have the same instruction set.\n\nSo, what is the simple point? The simple point is that a GPU isn't simply a GPU. A TPU from Apple isn't going to function and be tailored to function like a TPU from Google.

I however factored this population difference when I was estimating the total number of researchers in the west and China. My estimation derived a figure that indicated that the coalition of western nations had 2.5-3.0 times the number of researchers when compared to China.\n\n***But because China's population is so large they produce as many university graduates per year as the US and EU combined. Perhaps even more so.***\n\nEven though this claim does seem to be true according to UNESCO education database. I however disagree on the significance of this. As university graduates mean little if this talent is not being fully utilised in a relevant research environment. India also has a greater number of ISCED 6+/bachelor degrees than both China, and the west.  This variable clearly does not translate automatically to the research levels of a nation.\n\n***I think arguments that China is behind and will remain so for decades are short sighted. They appear to largely hinge on the idea that China would be unable to create EUV systems - this seems like a poor assumption.***\n\nI don\u2019t believe that China will never achieve EUV. Rather it\u2019s going to take significantly longer than anticipated than the estimations provided by many pro-Chinese outlets and analysts. The intrinsic difficulties involved with creating EUV is insane. Even when a fully functioning EUV machine is created for instance ASML 2004 alpha demo. It still took nearly twenty years to develop the infrastructure to turn it into a machine capable of high volume manufacturing represented by the ASML 3400C. Each ASML machine has up to 100,000 different components, with each component potentially having thousands of different parts at a nanometer layer scale such as ZEISS optical mirrors.\n\nThe speed of China\u2019s advancement in the domain of lithography also gives no impression of any accelerated progress relative to the west. For instance, SMEE released their SSA600 series in 2014 with 90nm resolution, followed by the SSA800 in 2023, a nine-year gap. In contrast, ASML released a DUV machine with 90nm resolution in 2002 and their first immersion DUV machine in 2007, a five-year gap.

That software can be difficult to shift to a competitor\u2019s system.  At its June shareholders meeting, Nvidia announced that CUDA now includes more than 300 code libraries and 600 AI models, and supports 3,700 GPU-accelerated applications used by more than five million developers at roughly 40,000 companies.\"\n* \"Babak Pahlavan, CEO of startup NinjaTech AI, says he would have used Nvidia\u2019s hardware and software to launch his company \u2014 if he could have afforded it. But shortages of Nvidia\u2019s powerful H100 chips have kept prices high and access challenging.  Pahlavan and his co-founders eventually turned to Amazon, which makes its own custom chips for training AI, the process by which such systems \u201clearn\u201d from huge troves of data. After months of effort, the team finally succeeded in training their AI on Amazon\u2019s chips, known as Trainium. It wasn\u2019t easy.  \u201cThere were lots of challenges and bugs,\u201d says Pahlavan, whose team at NinjaTech AI met four times a week, for months, with an Amazon software team ... To serve more than a million users a month, NinjaTech\u2019s cloud-services bill at Amazon is about $250,000 a month, says Pahlavan. If he were running the same AI on Nvidia chips, it would be between $750,000 and $1.2 million\"\n\nThere's a common criticism that CUDA locks customers into the Nvidia platform.  So NinjaTech AI claims to be saving money, but now they are locked into Amazon's cloud platform with Amazon as the only vendor, as opposed to Nvidia services available at all the world's major cloud computing providers, on-premise, or at many other vendors."}, {"author": "imrickjamesbioch", "created": 1723493769.0, "text": "It might sound crazy but tech people are creatures of habit and aren\u2019t big on change unlike people think.

Inference is one of the three ways that AI chips can \"power data centers\". I'll focus on the two main ones upfront through.\n\nIn AI applications, there are two major compute tasks to be done. One is training large models and the other is using those models to perform \"inference\" tasks as a response to user requests. Simply put, training is what creates the GPT-4 trillion parameter model, inferencing is when you ask that model a question.\n\nIt's important to track how much of the work at the data center is being used for each because companies train models (like, say chat GPT-4) because they *expect* users to want to use those models. So training loads are a *guess* about how popular AI will be made by the model trainers. Inferencing load corresponds to how much the model is *actually* getting used.\n\nIf 99% of the compute load was going to training and not inferencing, it would mean that, say, Microsoft still thinks AI is going to be really popular, but nobody is using their platforms very much yet. In a sense, we'd still be waiting to see how popular AI was going to be even if there weren't many users yet. Now, the majority of use is still for training, but the 40% number means that there is a healthy demand for inferencing as well. Eventually, inference is expected to take up probably more than... 90% of AI workloads when most models are build and users are... using them a lot.\n\n\nNote: the third way that these chips can be used in data centers is to accelerate non-AI compute loads, which also happens."}, {"author": "Trader_santa", "created": 1722635712.0, "text": "Today Inference is The goal, training is how to Get there.\nJensen envisions inference and training will become one, which would make sense for robots and self-driving I think"}, {"author": "Top-Pineapple5509", "created": 1722636581.0, "text": "Nvidia chips can be used for training LLM or inference LLM.\nOnce the chip is on the Data Center, Jensen said that it spends an average of 40% of the time making inference (hence 60% training).\nThis is to debunk the argument of some \"analysts\" that were saying Nvidia has the leading in training, but not in inference."}, {"author": "NotBanksy69", "created": 1722635204.0, "text": "I\u2019m not smart so I shared your question with ChatGPT, which if you think about it basically answers your question without reading further.\n\nHere\u2019s what GPT thinks:\n\nYour understanding of inference is spot on. In the context of AI and machine learning, inference indeed refers to using a trained model to make predictions or decisions based on new input data. \n\nThe reason Nvidia\u2019s revenue is skyrocketing due to inference can be explained as follows:\n\n1. **Increased Demand for AI Applications**: Inference is at the heart of many AI applications, such as natural language processing, computer vision, recommendation systems, and more. As businesses and industries increasingly adopt AI-driven solutions, the demand for hardware that can efficiently perform inference tasks grows. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are well-suited for these tasks, leading to higher sales.\n\n2. **Data Center Expansion**: Data centers are expanding rapidly to support the growing number of AI applications. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are often used in these data centers for both training and inference. The significant portion of revenue coming from inference indicates that many of these data centers are heavily utilizing Nvidia\u2019s GPUs to run AI models in real-time, which is essential for services that require quick and accurate predictions.\n\n3. **Efficiency and Performance**: Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are optimized for high-performance computing tasks, including inference. Companies prefer Nvidia\u2019s solutions because they provide the necessary computational power and efficiency to handle large-scale inference tasks. This efficiency translates into cost savings and performance improvements, making Nvidia\u2019s products attractive to enterprises.\n\n4. **Growth of Edge Computing**: Besides data centers, there\u2019s a growing trend of edge computing, where inference is performed closer to the source of data (e.g., IoT devices, autonomous vehicles). Nvidia\u2019s specialized hardware for edge computing also contributes to the increased revenue from inference.\n\nBy emphasizing the role of inference, Nvidia highlights the practical, real-world applications of their technology that are driving substantial revenue. While the demand for AI chips to power data centers is also crucial, the specific mention of inference points to the growing and ongoing usage of these chips in various AI-driven services and applications that generate continuous revenue streams."}, {"author": "mrtudbuttle", "created": 1722635684.0, "text": "Enlightening, somewhat."}, {"author": "Charuru", "created": 1722638032.0, "text": "Maybe you're misunderstanding inference as a client side thing.

Customers deploying Nvidia\u2019s GPUs for inference tasks (such as running AI models in production environments) would provide this usage data, enabling Nvidia to segment their revenue accordingly.\n\n2. **Product Segmentation and Sales Data**: Nvidia offers a range of products tailored for different AI tasks. Some products are optimized for training AI models, while others are optimized for inference. By analyzing the sales data of these specific product lines, Nvidia can estimate the portion of revenue attributed to inference.\n\n3. **Software and Licensing Data**: Nvidia provides software frameworks (like TensorRT) specifically designed for optimizing inference on their GPUs. The adoption and licensing of such software can provide insights into the extent of inference usage.\n\n4. **Internal Analytics**: Nvidia may have advanced analytics and monitoring tools that track the usage patterns of their GPUs in data centers. These tools can provide data on the computational loads and types of tasks (inference vs. training) being performed.\n\n5. **Industry Trends and Benchmarks**: Nvidia stays informed about industry trends and benchmarks, which can help them estimate the distribution of training versus inference workloads across their customer base.\n\nBy combining these data sources, Nvidia can make informed estimates about the proportion of their data center revenue driven by inference.

I know I see this happen every single quarter, but it still amazes me how many people will take things intentionally out of context and write an article so that they can make money off of their lie.\n\nA lot of things have been and are true, but it makes me sick how many people (journalist and news anchors) are willing to lie or twist something to keep their job, or to simply make more money. Like the whole Google and Meta thing, writing articles out of context to make it sound like they over purchased, and that they weren't going to purchase anymore. Then the articles start coming out telling the truth, which is of course that they will continue purchasing because to not have enough is much worse than having too much.\n\nP.S.

I took that question to mean, how did one foresee 100b annual revenue from gpu based systems at 80% gm.\n\nIn hindsight yeah, you can listen to huang. But listening to ceos spin a tale about how great their company, That is far from sufficient to pick a winner.\n\nMy comment about gpgpu being insignificant is from a revenue and ramp standpoint. In 2015 to 2022 their datacenter rampp and stock performance was very similar to amd comparing gains depending on exactly what time frame you look at. Obv 2022 onward has been a blowout.\n\nIts not just what their competitors say. See EVGA saying that nvidia has squeezed them so hard they can no longer make gpus, Linux (linus famousing saying nvidia is the worste and publicly flipping them off and saying, \"fuck you nvidia\"), GPP anticompetitive practices, and nvidia canceling HWU because they didnt say enough nice things about ray tracing. Amd has never canceled someone from a bad review, never had a partner publicly blast them for squeezing them out of business, and is a great linux partner. I get it, you are a fan of nvidia and huang . . . But lets not pretend. Amd/rtg is an incompetent partner. Nvidia is a greedy partner. They are not the same. I generally agree though that amds problems could be solved by better gpu hardware, better software support, and better development solutions. Nvidias schenanigans is not the primary cause of amds issues.\n\nAnd to be clear, i think nvidias business model of closed source is far superior to amds. As an investor idgaf about evga not being able to make gpus. Nvidia does the drivers, makes the gpu, qualities the memory, does all yhe hard shit. What do i care about an aib? I dont.\n\nWho cares if linus hates nvidia? Cry me a river the software nvidia does is amazing.\n\nBut lets make sure we understand . . . Being cutthroat in business can be a very good thing. For nvidia they have done very well. But lets not pretend.\n\nSelf driving and vr are not what contributed to nvidia being a 3t company. Without llm ai nvidia would still be sub 1T market cap. And yes, if you look at the hype that was surrounding them 2017 to 2019 . . . They flopped hard. Are they a thriving business unit for nvidia? Absolutely. But thwy are still a flop.

This potential swing is based on the company\u2019s $3.17 trillion market capitalization.\n\n**Scott Rubner**, managing director at Goldman Sachs noted that \u201cthe bar for Nvidia this earnings season is a lot lower than it has been in recent quarters,\u201d due to fundamental selling in the tech sector. Nvidia holds the record for the biggest one-day market value swing at $330 billion, which occurred in late July.\n\nAccording to the bank, if Nvidia reports strong growth and forward guidance, it could surprise the stock market and lead to a significant move. \u201cCan you imagine if NVDA beats expectations on Wednesday?\u201d asked Rubner.\n\n**Why It Matters**: Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings report is\u00a0[crucial for several reasons](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40585459/nvidia-stock-q2-earnings-preview-analyst-says-ai-cycle-far-from-over-company-has-fi). Analysts expect the company to report second-quarter revenue of $28.68 billion, a significant increase from $13.5 billion in the same quarter last year. Nvidia has consistently beaten revenue estimates in seven of the last eight quarters, showcasing its strong performance.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia is positioning itself as a central player in the AI ecosystem, akin to\u00a0**Amazon.com Inc.**\u00a0in e-commerce.\u00a0**Kevin Mahn**, CIO of\u00a0**Hennion & Walsh**, anticipates that Nvidia will surpass expectations, especially in its data center business, further solidifying its dominance in the AI sector.\n\nHowever, some experts caution that Nvidia\u2019s stock might face short-term setbacks.\u00a0**Gene Munster**, managing partner at\u00a0**Deepwater Asset Management**, points to potential supply-demand imbalances and delays in the Blackwell project, which could negatively impact investor sentiment despite the company\u2019s long-term growth prospects.\n\nTechnical analyst\u00a0**Carter Braxton Worth**\u00a0remains bullish on Nvidia, advising investors to adopt a long-term strategy around the earnings period. He believes the company\u2019s stock will continue its upward trajectory based on technical indicators.\""}, {"author": "HelloItsMeXeno", "created": 1724846594.0, "text": "D-day is upon us."}, {"author": "khanhncm", "created": 1724854064.0, "text": "150 day after earning"}, {"author": "NuvaS1", "created": 1724859192.0, "text": "Why is everyone panicking? it's trading sideways til earnings are announced.

I do understand the possibility of not being able to realize that the real world issues and rumors we need clarified and squashed for this quarter are greater than this year's previous quarters. What has changed is (again) real issues of a different nature to prior, the accumulation of kids and uneducated, trigger happy investors in NVidia that are willing to sell off with a slight gust of wind, and rumors preached as truths by journalists that want to stir you and I up (if they feel they can convince us). So, this isn't about a change in NVidia's fundamentals as the one all be all source for caution and self awareness/reality checking ourselves. \n\nTo be overly cautious rewards in dividends upon every success, and eliminates any strong worries when things go south. However, being overly over optimistic in any thing or aspect of life can result in catastrophe. Just a basic example is thinking back to friends of mine (when we were younger) always thinking if a girl looked in their direction that they must be the only guy they're looking at, when in reality she's just grinning at a girl friend of hers that's behind him. With this irrational sense of confidence there will be hard learned lessons. These days an over optimistic person can think a woman likes him, walk up to her and compliment her, and the girls these days may call it harassment. You can get yourself in real legal trouble with over optimism, as well as heartache, other forms of let downs, and eventually questioning everything you thought you knew.\n\nRemember, you can't hurt yourself by being on defense, cautious and strategic, but over optimism is a recipe for disaster in almost any given scenario of life, and the stock market is the last place for pride/over certainty of your thoughts without reservation for possibly making a bad move. I'm tempted to be more bullish than anyone. I believe we'll easily surpass $200 before Jan 1st, but I can't rely on that.

Here are some steps and resources to guide your research:\n\n\n\n### 1. \\*\\*Understand the Market Trends\\*\\*\n\n   - \\*\\*Data Growth:\\*\\* With the exponential increase in data generation, there is a growing demand for data storage, processing, and management. Research reports from firms like Gartner, IDC, and Statista provide insights into the projected growth of data and the data center market.\n\n   - \\*\\*Cloud Adoption:\\*\\* The shift towards cloud computing and the increasing reliance on cloud services drive demand for data centers. Look at cloud service providers' reports (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) to understand their data center expansion plans.\n\n\n\n### 2. \\*\\*Identify Key Players\\*\\*\n\n   - \\*\\*Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs):\\*\\* Companies like Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Realty Trust (DLR) are major players in the data center REIT sector. These companies own and operate data centers, and investing in them can be a way to gain exposure to the sector.\n\n   - \\*\\*Tech Giants:\\*\\* Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are significant investors in data centers. Analyzing their capital expenditure reports can give insights into their data center investments.\n\n   - \\*\\*Chipmakers and Hardware Providers:\\*\\* Companies like NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD produce the hardware that powers data centers. Researching their product pipelines and partnerships with data center providers could be valuable.\n\n\n\n### 3. \\*\\*Explore Emerging Technologies\\*\\*\n\n   - \\*\\*Edge Computing:\\*\\* With the rise of IoT, there's a growing need for data processing closer to the source. Companies developing edge computing solutions might present new investment opportunities.\n\n   - \\*\\*Green Data Centers:\\*\\* Sustainability is becoming a priority. Look for companies investing in energy-efficient or renewable energy-powered data centers.\n\n\n\n### 4. \\*\\*Monitor Regulatory and Economic Factors\\*\\*\n\n   - \\*\\*Government Policies:\\*\\* Research government initiatives and regulations regarding data security, privacy, and infrastructure investment. These can significantly impact the data center market.\n\n   - \\*\\*Energy Costs:\\*\\* Data centers are energy-intensive. Understanding trends in energy prices and the push towards renewable energy can influence your investment decisions.\n\n\n\n### 5. \\*\\*Access Industry Reports and Investment Research\\*\\*\n\n   - \\*\\*McKinsey, Deloitte, and PwC\\*\\* often publish industry reports that provide a broad overview of the data center industry.\n\n   - \\*\\*Morningstar and Seeking Alpha\\*\\* offer investment analysis and insights into publicly traded companies involved in the data center sector.\n\n   - \\*\\*ETFs:\\*\\* Consider researching ETFs focused on technology infrastructure or data centers, like the Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF (VPN).\n\n\n\n### 6. \\*\\*Consult Financial News and Analyst Opinions\\*\\*\n\n   - \\*\\*Bloomberg, CNBC, and Financial Times\\*\\* regularly cover developments in the data center industry, including mergers and acquisitions, new technological developments, and market trends.\n\n   - \\*\\*Equity Research Reports:\\*\\* Banks and financial institutions like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley often provide in-depth equity research reports on data center-related stocks.\n\n\n\n### 7. \\*\\*Academic and Industry Conferences\\*\\*\n\n   - \\*\\*Attend conferences or webinars\\*\\* hosted by industry associations like the Uptime Institute or AFCOM, where experts discuss the future of data centers, emerging trends, and investment opportunities.\n\n\n\nBy combining these resources, you'll be able to build a comprehensive understanding of the investment landscape surrounding the data center boom."}, {"author": "Medium_Job3015", "created": 1724352175.0, "text": "Na.

Cisco dominated the networking equipment market during the dot-com boom, while NVDA capitalizes on the exploding AI and data center markets.\n* **Overreliance on Internal Metrics:**\u00a0Both Cisco's \"virtual close\" system and NVDA's internal projections might have created a blind spot towards external economic factors. Cisco failed to anticipate the dot-com bubble burst, just as NVDA's current valuation might not fully reflect potential economic downturns or increased competition.\n* **Growth Bias:**\u00a0Both companies exhibited a strong growth bias, which is common in the technology sector. This bias can lead to overestimations of future demand and, consequently, overproduction and inventory issues, as seen with Cisco.\n\n**Differences:**\n\n* **Economic Climate:**\u00a0The dot-com bubble was a period of speculative frenzy, while the current economic climate, though facing challenges, appears more stable. This suggests that a Cisco-like crash, while possible, is not necessarily inevitable for NVDA.\n* **Market Diversification:**\u00a0NVDA operates in a more diversified market than Cisco did in 2001. While Cisco focused primarily on networking equipment, NVDA caters to various sectors like gaming, data centers, and automotive, potentially mitigating risks associated with a downturn in a single market.\n* **Macroeconomic Awareness:**\u00a0The article suggests that Cisco failed to incorporate macroeconomic indicators into its forecasts. Today, companies like NVDA are more aware of these factors and might be better equipped to react to changing economic conditions.\n\n**What it Portends for NVDA's Future:**\n\n* **Valuation Correction:**\u00a0NVDA's current valuation, like any high-flying stock, is subject to correction. However, the degree and speed of this correction depend on factors like market sentiment, competition, and broader economic performance.\n* **Importance of Adaptation:**\u00a0NVDA's future success hinges on its ability to adapt to changing market dynamics, avoid overdependence on any single sector, and maintain a realistic outlook on future growth.\n* **Lessons Learned:**\u00a0The tech industry can learn from Cisco's experience. Incorporating macroeconomic factors into forecasting models, diversifying product portfolios, and fostering a culture of realistic projections are crucial for sustainable growth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the similarities between Cisco's 2001 crash and NVDA's current trajectory warrant caution, drawing a direct parallel would be simplistic. NVDA benefits from a more diversified market and a heightened awareness of macroeconomic factors. However, the company must remain vigilant, adapt to evolving conditions, and temper its growth expectations to avoid repeating history. The future of its valuation rests on its ability to navigate these complexities successfully."}, {"author": "ButtStuffingt0n", "created": 1724883760.0, "text": "Agreed.

Here's the facts and the rundown..\n\n**Blackwell Delays:**\n\n1. **Timeline Shift**: Nvidia initially communicated to the market up until the leaks around the Yen Carry Trade crash that it expected to launch Blackwell earlier in 2024. Now they're saying the production ramp will start in Q4 2024, which suggests there have been delays. If you've read any of the latest analyst notes, they're now expecting production around mid 2025. Can you risk an upcoming ratecut cycle rotation and potential deceleration into a product cycle shift? If you're an actual investor that has been in Nvidia for years, very likely so. If you're a late-comer...\n2. **Design Adjustments**: Even though Nvidia says there were \"no functional changes\" needed, the fact that changes were made this late in the process indicates there were unforeseen issues, which is a sign of delays.\n3. **Impact on Market**: Delays in production mean Blackwell might not be widely available until well into 2025. This could hurt Nvidia's ability to continue the bubble if Hyperscalers decide 'enough is enough'.\n4. **Investor Messaging**: Nvidia saying \"no delay\" seems more like an attempt to keep investors calm rather than reflecting the actual timeline. The reality is, the timeline has shifted, which is a delay.\n\nSo, while Nvidia is trying to downplay it, the timeline for Blackwell has been pushed back, and that\u2019s not great news for them.\n\nDisclosure, I am short Nvidia but I am also trying to prevent folks who are likely unaware of the AI market or the tech cycles from losing their shirts."}, {"author": "Charuru", "created": 1724882250.0, "text": "There is a delay, just capitalizing it doesn\u2019t make it true.

When/if they sell, they don't sell it back to you. They can't make you buy it back. Someone else buys the contract if the original buyer decides to sell it. You are still obligated by that agreement you signed and sold, just to someone else now. That whole thing is irrelevant to you. What's relevant is you have to buy it back on your end if you want to close it out, who you buy it back from is also irrelevant as long as the values equal out. Don't think it in terms of a direct trade with one person, there are tens of thousands of contracts changing hands thus any two identical ones are the same value and can be exchanged/substituted.\n\nSo in your case and to answer your question, think of it this way. It's like if I told you I'll sell you 100 apples for $2 each by end of august whenever you want, but for me to hold the apples I want you to pay me a deposit of $50. If you don't buy them by that date, then I will not honor this agreement but keep your deposit obviously. I am giving you the option to buy my apples for $2ea only if you want to, but you are not obligated to buy it if you don't want to.  You agree and pay me $50 (my premium) and I sign a legally binding paper for this agreement to WHOEVER (not only you) holds that paper. You keep this paper you paid $50 for, so that's the value of that paper. Then let's say apples became high in demand, they are being sold for $2.5 at the supermarket. You are lucky, the paper you are holding is worth more now because you can buy my apples for under the supermarket price. Now, you can exercise that agreement and buy 100 apples from me for $200 which is $50 cheaper than if you bought it from the market. Or you can sell that paper agreement to someone else for more than the $50 you paid me and make a profit easy. As the signer of that paper, I am still legally bound by that agreement to the new owner otherwise he would be getting screwed. \n\n\n\nSince you are selling the calls, now imagine you are the apple seller. That's where you are if the original buyer sold it to someone else, you are still obligated by the paper you sold , to sell your shares at the strike price you sold the call for IF they exercise it. So, no you don't really know if you'll keep your shares and the premium yet, the contract you signed and sold is still active and you are obligated by it. It is just being held by someone else.  As long as the option is open and you didn't buy one back to cancel out yours (meaning you pay back the premium you collected less or more than what you got depending if the stock moved up or down since you sold the option), then the holder of the call you sold can exercise it and buy your shares from you.\n\nAlso they can exercise at any time, not only at the end.  it doesn't make sense to exercise it before it reaches the strike + whatever they paid for the option contract (breakeven) because it would be cheaper to buy stocks from the market thus they'd lose money, but it can happen nonetheless.\n\nThus by selling calls you are either hoping that stock doesn't reach the strike price and expires worthless so you keep the premium, or you feel ok to sell the stocks at the strike price you sold your call for. it hits the strike price and the buyer exercises it so you keep the premium plus sell the 100 stocks for more than what you paid for making a nice profit.  Meanwhile at any point you can buy back the option to close it out, which will worth more if the stock moved up thus you lose money. Or stock moved down and you buy the option cheaper than what you sold it for thus you kept some of the premium and made money.  but now you are not obligated to sell your stocks anymore. \n\nI am sure this can be explained in a much shorter way than I wrote but hope it helps, and congrats and fuck you for having so many Nvidia I am jealous lol."}, {"author": "civilized-engineer", "created": 1724102487.0, "text": "If nobody executes it then yes.

Here's a breakdown of when and how they buy the stock back:\n\n# When Companies Buy Back Stock:\n\n1. **Timing**: Companies typically buy back shares when they believe their stock is undervalued, they have excess cash, or they want to return value to shareholders. Buybacks often occur over a period of time rather than all at once, allowing companies to take advantage of price fluctuations.\n2. **Authorization and Discretion**: A company\u2019s board of directors authorizes a stock buyback program, setting a maximum dollar amount or number of shares to be repurchased. The actual timing of the buybacks is usually at the discretion of management, allowing them flexibility to execute based on market conditions.\n3. **Quiet Periods**: Companies generally avoid buybacks during \"quiet periods\"\u2014typically the time shortly before earnings announcements or other major corporate events\u2014to avoid any appearance of insider trading.\n\n# How Companies Buy Back Stock:\n\n1. **Open Market Purchases**: The most common method, where companies buy shares directly from the market like any other investor. This is done through a broker, and purchases are spread over time to minimize impact on the stock price.\n2. **Tender Offers**: The company offers to buy back a specific number of shares at a premium to the current market price. Shareholders can choose to sell their shares back at the offered price. This method can be faster but is generally more expensive.\n3. **Private Negotiations**: Companies may negotiate directly with large shareholders to buy back shares. This is less common and usually done when a significant amount of stock needs to be bought quickly without affecting the market price.\n4. **Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR)**: In this method, the company buys a large block of shares upfront from an investment bank, which then buys shares over time to cover the short position. ASRs provide an immediate reduction in share count but are often costlier due to the premium paid to the investment bank.\n\n# Key Considerations:\n\n* **Regulatory Compliance**: Companies must comply with SEC rules (in the U.S.) or equivalent regulations in other countries, such as the Rule 10b-18, which provides a \"safe harbor\" for companies buying back their shares in a way that limits market manipulation.\n* **Disclosure**: Companies must disclose their buyback plans in their financial statements and sometimes through press releases, detailing the extent of the buybacks and their impact on financial metrics like earnings per share (EPS).\n* **Impact on Stock Price**: While buybacks can support or increase the stock price by reducing the supply of shares, the actual impact depends on the size of the buyback relative to the market and the perception of the company\u2019s financial health.\n\nThis approach helps companies manage their capital structure, reward shareholders, and potentially boost the stock price over time."}, {"author": "ashczq", "created": 1725020796.0, "text": "When you sell"}, {"author": "jesus_does_crossfit", "created": 1725107510.0, "text": "When it retests support levels... everyone likes a deal!"}, {"author": "slinkywheel", "created": 1724994784.0, "text": "50b on a 3t company is like 1.67%"}, {"author": "Commercial-Echo1098", "created": 1724994248.0, "text": "No, this is not bullish on the stock.

Here\u2019s why:\n\n### **Benefits to Company Performance:**\n\n1. **Higher Profit Margins**: Improved yields mean that more functional chips are produced from each wafer, reducing the cost per chip. This directly contributes to higher profit margins, which is favorable for the company's financial performance.\n\n2. **Increased Supply**: With higher yields, NVIDIA can produce more units of their GPUs, which is particularly important during high-demand periods, such as the launch of a new product. Meeting or exceeding market demand helps maximize revenue and market share.\n\n3. **Better Product Quality**: Yield improvements often correlate with higher product reliability and performance consistency. This can lead to fewer defects, returns, or warranty claims, which not only saves costs but also enhances the company\u2019s reputation and customer satisfaction.\n\n4. **Stronger Market Position**: Successfully improving yields before release can give NVIDIA a competitive edge, allowing them to deliver more products at a lower cost or higher quality compared to competitors. This can reinforce their market leadership in sectors like gaming, AI, and data centers.\n\n5. **Positive Investor Sentiment**: If NVIDIA can demonstrate that they are efficiently managing production and improving yields before product release, it boosts investor confidence. This often leads to positive sentiment in the stock market, potentially driving up the stock price.\n\n6. **Smooth Product Launch**: Improved yields can help ensure that a product launch proceeds smoothly without supply shortages or quality issues. A successful launch strengthens brand reputation and supports continued sales momentum.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhen NVIDIA makes yield-improving changes to a mask before a product release, it usually leads to better overall company performance. The company benefits from higher profit margins, increased supply, better product quality, and stronger market positioning\u2014all of which are likely to have a positive impact on financial results and investor confidence."}, {"author": "shieldwolfBK", "created": 1724879965.0, "text": "Buy time"}, {"author": "khanhncm", "created": 1724880797.0, "text": "this is non sense, earlier the day, it's ANF, now NVDA. \nis this meme market afterall?"}, {"author": "coveredcallnomad100", "created": 1724894739.0, "text": "Closes green tomorrow"}, {"author": "captain_baratheon", "created": 1724883514.0, "text": "Gonna be a lot of bag holders ngl"}, {"author": "hailfire27", "created": 1724877941.0, "text": "They wanted to see 33 billion"}, {"author": "Mission_Wall_1074", "created": 1724882060.0, "text": "$117 after hour?"}, {"author": "No Author", "created": 1724877306.0, "text": "[deleted]"}, {"author": "Rooby_Booby", "created": 1724878653.0, "text": "Stupid question, but why are earnings called \u2018FY2025 2nd Q\u2019 and not 2024?"}, {"author": "No Author", "created": 1724881035.0, "text": "[deleted]"}, {"author": "Exact-Tangerine-4121", "created": 1724882554.0, "text": "Blackwell is a step function leap above Hopper."}, {"author": "dahhello", "created": 1724888109.0, "text": "Holding nvdx but at least it's not options lol"}, {"author": "Wide-Dig1848", "created": 1724878114.0, "text": "I'm a bit confused of what's happening"}, {"author": "Emergency-Pumpkin574", "created": 1724881376.0, "text": "Why is nvda down after a great earnings call?"}, {"author": "coveredcallnomad100", "created": 1724949852.0, "text": "The Max Pain for NVDA options expiring on Aug 30, 2024 (3 days) (w) is $120.00."}, {"author": "sixpointnineup", "created": 1724878200.0, "text": "This does not read well for Rubin.

NVDA\u2019s price movements are increasingly driven by sentiment, media narratives, and the broader socio-political landscape rather than by traditional technical indicators. This stock behaves unpredictably, almost like a teenager reacting emotionally to the latest news or rumors, making it a prime target for sentiment-driven manipulation.\n\nOne of the clearest examples of this is the recent drop in NVDA\u2019s stock price following a Bloomberg article that raised concerns about potential shifts in U.S. policy towards Taiwan, coinciding with the stellar earnings report from one of NVDA\u2019s major suppliers in Taiwan. The timing of this article, published in August 2024 but referring to comments made by former President Trump back in June, appears strategically aimed at influencing market sentiment just as NVDA\u2019s performance should have been buoyed by strong fundamentals.\n\nAdditionally, the market has been rife with rumors, such as those regarding Blackwell\u2019s influence on the stock, potential changes in Japanese loans, and even speculation that Warren Buffett might be reducing his stake in Apple. These rumors, amplified by media coverage, contribute to a climate of uncertainty and fear, driving NVDA\u2019s stock lower even in the face of positive earnings.\n\nFurther exacerbating this situation were reports from Politico in July 2024, suggesting that NVDA might face a Department of Justice investigation over its AI chip market dominance. This news further dampened investor confidence, leading to a notable drop in the stock price. Intriguingly, during this period of heightened negative sentiment, Nancy Pelosi made a significant investment in NVDA, purchasing 10,000 shares\u2014an act that has raised eyebrows given her history of well-timed trades that often coincide with sensitive political developments   .\n\nTo add to this, last Friday saw an unusually high number of NVDA options contracts expiring, with the stock\u2019s price being held tightly between $117 and $123, despite strong earnings. The fact that these contracts expired just below key strike prices raises serious concerns about potential manipulation aimed at maximizing profits for certain market participants.\n\nGiven these observations, it seems imperative for regulatory bodies to investigate the forces at play behind NVDA\u2019s recent price movements. The coordinated timing of media reports, coupled with strategic trading by high-profile investors, suggests that NVDA\u2019s stock may be more susceptible to manipulation than previously thought. Investors should approach NVDA with caution, recognizing that its price may not always reflect its underlying value due to these external influences."}, {"author": "gosumofo", "created": 1725077765.0, "text": "Just three weeks ago, it hit $90.

That difference matters a lot.\n\nFor short term trader its highly volatile and possibly going down quite a bit. Keep the position size small and only risk money you can lose or are willing to leave in the position for a long time. \n\nFor long term investors its really just a matter of do you dca or are you investing as much as often as you can? I think Tom Nash has a decent approach to this issue. He regularly tells people if they believe in a stock and have a regular dca perhaps increase it slightly when the stock dips below a certain threshold. When it goes back above the threshold go back to your regular dca amounts. That makes sense to me.\n\nPersonally I think NVDA is a great company, but the market price for the shares is super volatile so entering and exiting the position for a profit in the short term can be tough. I have a tiny recurring daily investment going into the position. I have a small number of shares and a large debit spread position for later this year and another for late in 2025. I expect the stock can easily drop a lot or it could take off on a day when no one expects it too. \n\nThat is kind of how its happened in the past. Remember before the split how it ran down into the 700s from the 900s and then back up. It went sideways, up and down over a decent range for awhile and then suddenly popped over. During that entire time there were people expecting it to pop up any day now and they were buying calls based upon that assumption. I think a lot of them got burned. The folks who sold during those plunges also got burned because it turned around and ran right back up and then some. \n\nSo with that in mind I think people who are buying rapidly at any point need to realize they can get burned if their goal is to sell within the next few months. If you cant stomach the volatility of this stock you probably shouldn't invest large amounts into it. In my case I expect that the money Ive put into the position wont come back out for years."}, {"author": "BiggieAndTheStooges", "created": 1725160860.0, "text": "What happened to all the rocket emojis?"}, {"author": "downbad12878", "created": 1725083299.0, "text": "You know what the truth to be but you refuse to believe it because you are a bagholder"}, {"author": "Lelouch25", "created": 1725094555.0, "text": "Yeah not holding.
