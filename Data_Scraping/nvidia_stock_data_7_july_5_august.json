Smoot-Hawley doesn't refer to all the tariffs in response, it simply refers to the bill by the US. \n\nAggriculture was hurt as much if not more than any industry by Smoot-Hawley and that it lasted into the 30s...I don't take your point. As we're seeing right now, a Taiff war takes a LOONG time to get past. \n\nWE already had 'buy American steel,' bills (one was passed by the Senator from Wisconsin, Baldwin for example). \n\nThere's never one thing that creates a great recession or depression, but Smoot-Hawley was what turned an incredible recovery around. \n\nIt was ALL tied to the tariffs. I've never seen an argument to the contrary in any econ or finance class that doesn't talk about the disastrous policy that Smoot-Hawley was. I thnk that you're pointing to the fact that they didn't COMPLETELY recover to the same levels misses the point. They were ON THEIR WAY to recovery until the World's largest economy added another 20% tariff on what was already a significant import fee. \n\nChina is NOT \"dominating' high-end tech(The US is...so far ahead of China in 'high-end tech,' it's comical, green energy, EVs(they're not competing with China.\n\n  \nChina has been the largest or the 2nd largest economy in the world since 1500. \n\nA flat tariff across the board is a disaster for the economy. And the candidate from one party has repeatedly called them a \"tax on China,\" when in fact...they're a tax on American business. \n\n  \nThe US has recovered FAR-FAR better than China which is actually as weak as it's been in quite some time right now. \n\n  \n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smoot-hawley-tariff-act.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smoot-hawley-tariff-act.asp)"}], "created": 1719856466.0}, {"title": "Exclusive-Nvidia set to face French antitrust charges, sources say", "author": "007_King", "score": 33, "comments": [{"author": "RemindMeBot", "created": 1719857489.0, "text": "I will be messaging you in 6 months on [**2025-01-01 18:10:46 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-01-01%2018:10:46%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1dsy90g/exclusivenvidia_set_to_face_french_antitrust/lb5utw6/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FNVDA_Stock%2Fcomments%2F1dsy90g%2Fexclusivenvidia_set_to_face_french_antitrust%2Flb5utw6%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202025-01-01%2018%3A10%3A46%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%201dsy90g)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|"}], "created": 1719853644.0}, {"title": "\u2705 Daily Chat Thread and Discussion \u2705", "author": "AutoModerator", "score": 13, "comments": [{"author": "max2jc", "created": 1719950706.0, "text": "Thanks for your advice."}], "created": 1719806477.0}, {"title": "Nvidia:   A $270B Cash Gusher", "author": "norcalnatv", "score": 85, "comments": [{"author": "RemindMeBot", "created": 1719809151.0, "text": "I will be messaging you in 1 month on [**2024-08-01 04:45:03 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2024-08-01%2004:45:03%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1dsess9/nvidia_a_270b_cash_gusher/lb30tt2/?context=3)\n\n[**2 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FNVDA_Stock%2Fcomments%2F1dsess9%2Fnvidia_a_270b_cash_gusher%2Flb30tt2%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202024-08-01%2004%3A45%3A03%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%201dsess9)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|"}], "created": 1719790465.0}, {"title": "8 chart-based reasons why the recent downtrend is over", "author": "Dying_Daily", "score": 58, "comments": [{"author": "NewbieRetard", "created": 1720029422.0, "text": "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 Let the game continue.
