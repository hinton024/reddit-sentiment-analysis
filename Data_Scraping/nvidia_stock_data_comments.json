That's the timeframe it takes for the HW to leap ahead to the point that it makes sense to throw out/sell off your old gear and buy new hardware.  NVDA is on a 1-year refresh cadence.\n\nCase and point is B200 replacing H100.  The reason people will refresh is because it is faster and burns less energy. It's a big win in terms of TCO.\n\nThis is not a game of musical chairs where the music stops and everyone stops buying."}]
