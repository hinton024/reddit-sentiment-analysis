Nuclear science has done amazing things for research, medicine, energy generation, and other things, but it doesn't get us to the stars, and we still have coal, oil, and gas power stations, and the cost of generation of power is still high.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm not saying AI won't be important, useful, open up opportunities, but I think it's worth while tempering expectations.

AI compute used for training today is substantial, but less than 50% and will keep declining as a percentage.   \n\nTime is required to validate and research different SOTA models using this approach (there's a lot more than just LLMs), develop hardware, adopt the approach, and develop an ecosystem. \n\nIMO\n\n1. This paper is exciting because it brings us closer to having powerful edge AI solutions (e.g. robots, autonomous vehicles, AI on personal devices) where power and compute are both at a premium and usage is almost all inference. APPL and MSFT should be interested.\n\n2. Using arithmetic with ternary values is a simple operation compared to floating point. It's unclear that Nvidia would be able to maintain a moat for inference. \n\n3. If approaches like this pan out, it would most likely take years before impacting NVDA at the datacenter. However, the impact could be much sooner for edge AI. \n\nSource: Claude 3.5 and GPT 4o discussing this paper with me moderating. Here's the tail end of a lengthy discussion where their conclusions agree that the FP reduction could be around 30% for training and 90% for inference. No one really knows for sure though, without more independent research.  \n\n------------\n\nChat GPT 4o concurs with Claude 3.5 on 90% reduction in FP operations for inference.\n\nGPT 4o summarizing both views for training: \n\nWhile the MatMul-free approach provides substantial efficiency gains, particularly in reducing the computational complexity of the forward pass, the overall training process still requires significant FP operations, especially during the backward pass. Therefore, a more conservative estimate of around 25-30% reduction in FP operations during the entire training process is more realistic.\n\nThis balanced view acknowledges the significant contributions of the paper while maintaining a realistic perspective on the extent of FP operation reductions in training.\n\nClause 3.5 Sonnet on Nvida moat for this approach: \n\nThis approach is indeed different enough that CUDA, in its current form, would not provide as strong a moat for inference chips specifically designed for this ternary arithmetic approach. The fundamental differences in computation could create an opening for competitors to develop new, highly optimized solutions without the need to compete directly with CUDA's strengths.\n\nHowever, several factors mitigate this risk for NVIDIA:\n\n1. NVIDIA's resources and expertise could allow them to quickly adapt and develop optimized solutions for this new approach.\n2. The broader AI ecosystem, including training and other non-ternary models, would still benefit from CUDA.\n3. NVIDIA's overall hardware expertise and manufacturing capabilities remain significant advantages.\n\nIn summary, while this approach could reduce CUDA's effectiveness as a moat specifically for ternary-based inference chips, NVIDIA's overall position in the AI hardware market would likely remain strong due to their ability to adapt, their broader ecosystem, and their hardware expertise. The impact would be more pronounced if this approach becomes dominant in both training and inference across a wide range of AI applications."}], "created": 1719419553.0}, {"title": "Jensen Huang - Annual Shareholder Meeting Notes", "author": "Xtianus21", "score": 703, "comments": [{"author": "SushiAssassin-", "created": 1719509871.0, "text": "Lmao you know it\u2019s real"}], "created": 1719419076.0}, {"title": "From the technology community on Reddit: Researchers upend AI status quo by eliminating matrix multiplication in LLMs", "author": "reampchamp", "score": 10, "comments": [{"author": "SushiAssassin-", "created": 1719509871.0, "text": "Lmao you know it\u2019s real"}], "created": 1719409593.0}, {"title": "Nvidia 24/06/26 pre market sudden dump help me understand ", "author": "funalone1", "score": 17, "comments": [{"author": "Shot_Statistician249", "created": 1719417901.0, "text": "For us"}], "created": 1719408381.0}, {"title": "Upcoming earnings in August, EPS is flat?", "author": "trashyart200", "score": 23, "comments": [{"author": "jazzjustice", "created": 1719667484.0, "text": "First one that comes to mind, is the religion of the Teslarati..and their latest earnings:\n\n\"Tesla Stock Jumps on Accelerated Production Plans Despite Earnings Miss\" - [https://www.investopedia.com/tesla-q1-fy2024-earnings-8637735](https://www.investopedia.com/tesla-q1-fy2024-earnings-8637735)\n\nBut the CEO of Nvidia would never engage in the unpunished stock manipulation the CEO from Tesla engages in.

I want to hear someone explain why it will be and give me info to do my own research and if it makes sense to me I add an amount to my portfolio commensurate to my level of confidence after reviewing everything, or if I cannot justify it at this price I'll sit out. I really wish I invested when I first saw it, but I don't wanna be the guy who just buys at the top due to FOMO and watches it sink back down or float around for no meaningful result. The other thing I keep thinking about is that I knew about BTC and sat out for many years before finally taking the plunge in 2022, if I bought in when I first heard of it I'd be a multi millionaire now, I've made money on that position anyway, but nowhere near what it could be as I knew about it when it was a few hundred dollars a coin.

Look, I'm not trying to be negative toward any of this at all. I'm mainly saying I HOPE they are being treated well and being taken care of. I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who worked customer service for longer than I should have. The business aspect is on 2 different playing fields and I'm only speaking from experience in a trade field vs a publicly traded company in the tech field. So there, yes I am wrong. That's my bad. Two different types of companies. I ain't perfect lol\nNow, as far as back to the employees, I'm more talking about like a one time end of year bonus for the CS reps that deal with more of the mental side of customer complaints, problems, etc. those guys are only making around 48k a yr (depending on where you live. Ex. I'm in CA so cost of living out here is complete shit) \nMost of their manufacturing, distribution, and engineering jobs are ranging from 150k-330k which is REALLY good money and deserved. \nSo, a simple one time bonus for the end of the year for their CS reps or even their test operators that actually make the lowest amount (around 28-30k) if they got a nice little bonus as an appreciation, that would be a really cool thing to see a CEO do for them in this kind of spot light they are in. \nLike I said, not at all trying to be negative, I just think showing appreciation for everyone is deserved for all of them working together to get to this point and being able to maintain and succeed. That's all man. Might sound stupid but if you've worked in customer service for big companies, you'd understand the daily stupidity on a whole other level you deal with, mentally, that sometimes when you see your company thriving big time, you hope appreciation and validation come your way since you deal with the shitty side of the company. \nIt would literally cost him only 29 mill to give every single employee a $1000 bonus from that 700 mill. Shit, he could give them all a $5000 bonus (steep) and it would only be 148 mill out of that 700 Lol that's chump change for him, but helpful to the cogs in the NVDA machine. \n\nYou can downvote it, you can think it's stupid but I'm only thinking of the lower class people that do the shit jobs there who people don't think about. \nI hope you enjoy the rest of your day \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb"}], "created": 1717690353.0}, {"title": "Nvidia's grasp of desktop GPU market balloons to 88% \u2014 AMD has just 12%, Intel negligible, says JPR", "author": "norcalnatv", "score": 84, "comments": [{"author": "codeboss911", "created": 1717807462.0, "text": "they will if they want to keep up and compete with others... \n\nif your bot works faster then the other, you could take the entire market from that alone\n\nentire search engines and browsers are switched over to just for speed alone....\n\nanyways, im all in and holding nvda"}], "created": 1717689323.0}, {"title": "Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia bests back-to-back winner Microsoft to be named Fortune 500\u2019s best-led company \u2014 FORTUNE", "author": "norcalnatv", "score": 76, "comments": [{"author": "YouMissedNVDA", "created": 1717691635.0, "text": "His interviews from over a decade ago have aged like fine wine.\n\n\"I believe nvidia can become one of the most important companies in computing\"\n\n\nAs he would say, it's very important to have a good history."}], "created": 1717688175.0}, {"title": "NVDA split", "author": "Plastic-Awareness-61", "score": 54, "comments": [{"author": "DickRiculous", "created": 1717719098.0, "text": "lol wtf?"}], "created": 1717678268.0}, {"title": "POV: waiting for NVDA to dip so I can buy", "author": "GRed-saintevil", "score": 260, "comments": [{"author": "GRed-saintevil", "created": 1717777268.0, "text": "i'll look it up"}], "created": 1717663494.0}, {"title": "Reactions.

How do you think this stock is climbing to the heavens? \n\nI think you misunderstand why I posted the video. This entire thing. This entire GPU extravaganza is predicated on Open AI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and the rest of the world X China finds incredible gains in the advancement of AI. \n\nThere is literally an AI industrial revolution happening before our eyes and Nvidia is at the head of it. The previous industrial revolution spanned from about 1760 - 1840. That's 80 years. \n\nTo think that after year 2ish/3ish of in earnest Open AI GPT3,3.5,4,4o that it is some crazy off the wall statement to assume that companies are more towards a 5% build out of accelerated compute is puzzling to me at best. \n\nMoreover, the chip constraint due to manufacturing capacity is another obvious sign that TSM and Intel are working hard to address. It's more likely that we are at the beginning stages rather than the middle and or end. Maybe it's 10% - 15% for some, 2% for others and 75% for startups. Who knows. Overall, I am simply saying that Jensen made the point to say that during the call and I think it was insightful.

I'm not counting on those to pay off to fund my retirement. As I said, it is an insignificant amount of money. A couple thousand. It's a fraction of a percent of my portfolio. \n\nThis isn't an investment strategy, this is like buying a lottery ticket with a few bucks. QBTS and RGTI, I bought each for...\\~80 cents a share and bought 2-3K shares. \n\n>  \nI'm in NVDA with much smaller positions in MSFT, AMZN and GOOG\n\nSame here, also MSFT and TSM. I do not have 17 years though(congrats...I hope that's funding a great retirement either now or whenever you choose). I didn't get in until '20 despite a good friend from College telling me years earlier. I just didn't have the liquidity. 17 years ago I was just a year out of Law School. Still kicking myself, but I choose to invest in real estate with the money I did have. Liquidated last year and put the rest in those stocks(\\~20% bonds). \n\nBut I have a few thousand shares in those companies...and I don't think I'll be doing anything with those in the near future. Maybe TSM due to the risk of China(though if that pops off, it's going to destroy the rest of those investments and who knows what will happen). I like that they're moving plants to Japan and AZ...\n\n  \nI really appreciate the response though...and congrats on getting in on NVDA so early."}], "created": 1715565002.0}, {"title": "\u2705 Daily Chat Thread and Discussion \u2705", "author": "AutoModerator", "score": 4, "comments": [{"author": "Charuru", "created": 1715523211.0, "text": "Puts on soundhound?\n\nhttps://mashable.com/article/openai-announcement-monday-voice-assistant"}], "created": 1715486446.0}, {"title": "Dario says AI models in the next few years will cost $100B.", "author": "TheColombian916", "score": 42, "comments": [{"author": "goodbodha", "created": 1715475393.0, "text": "Absolutely agree they will need to make a return on that investment or they will be punished for it in the stock price at some point.

Too many big companies with a whole bunch of really smart people see something that they believe is worth pursuing. \n\nThey could be wrong about the potential or they might be right. I just dont see a group of people that large changing their mind quickly so this will likely go on for several years before they are either more convinced or doubts start to creep in. Even with doubts I suspect the inertia will keep this going for several years beyond that. If they feel proven right within the next few years we are probably just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Just to put it in perspective look at bitcoin right now and all the believers. How long now has that been going on? Or maybe we should look at the amount of time from the early days of the internet to the dot com bust and then on to where we are today."}], "created": 1715392265.0}, {"title": "1 year cadence", "author": "Charuru", "score": 13, "comments": [{"author": "norcalnatv", "created": 1715427830.0, "text": "Kopite7kimi is full of BS.
