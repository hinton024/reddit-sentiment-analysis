So they tested it in the boys bathroom during class so nobody was in there. Didn\u2019t make the news. Didn\u2019t have the cops called. School had them stay late everyday to work off the damage and called their parents. Not saying they should\u2019ve done this, but they weren\u2019t criminals either. Just overly curious about demolition since this was Dad\u2019s job. Now these boys would be in handcuffs. Obviously grown now and that one childhood mistake didn\u2019t define their lives.

Look, I'm not trying to be negative toward any of this at all. I'm mainly saying I HOPE they are being treated well and being taken care of. I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who worked customer service for longer than I should have. The business aspect is on 2 different playing fields and I'm only speaking from experience in a trade field vs a publicly traded company in the tech field. So there, yes I am wrong. That's my bad. Two different types of companies. I ain't perfect lol\nNow, as far as back to the employees, I'm more talking about like a one time end of year bonus for the CS reps that deal with more of the mental side of customer complaints, problems, etc. those guys are only making around 48k a yr (depending on where you live. Ex. I'm in CA so cost of living out here is complete shit) \nMost of their manufacturing, distribution, and engineering jobs are ranging from 150k-330k which is REALLY good money and deserved. \nSo, a simple one time bonus for the end of the year for their CS reps or even their test operators that actually make the lowest amount (around 28-30k) if they got a nice little bonus as an appreciation, that would be a really cool thing to see a CEO do for them in this kind of spot light they are in. \nLike I said, not at all trying to be negative, I just think showing appreciation for everyone is deserved for all of them working together to get to this point and being able to maintain and succeed. That's all man. Might sound stupid but if you've worked in customer service for big companies, you'd understand the daily stupidity on a whole other level you deal with, mentally, that sometimes when you see your company thriving big time, you hope appreciation and validation come your way since you deal with the shitty side of the company. \nIt would literally cost him only 29 mill to give every single employee a $1000 bonus from that 700 mill. Shit, he could give them all a $5000 bonus (steep) and it would only be 148 mill out of that 700 Lol that's chump change for him, but helpful to the cogs in the NVDA machine. \n\nYou can downvote it, you can think it's stupid but I'm only thinking of the lower class people that do the shit jobs there who people don't think about. \nI hope you enjoy the rest of your day \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb"}], "created": 1717690353.0}, {"title": "Diamond hands 200 a share is my out position", "author": "No Author", "score": 177, "comments": [{"author": "d4ve3000", "created": 1718488712.0, "text": "Not all \ud83e\udd23 luckily i was smart enough to throw everything back in at 600"}], "created": 1718321827.0}, {"title": "Blessed to have invested 3 years ago, @long NVDA", "author": "OutflyingA320", "score": 174, "comments": [{"author": "FriendlyPea805", "created": 1722479135.0, "text": "Same to you!\ud83d\ude4f"}], "created": 1722473684.0}, {"title": "Went from 18 shares to 58 shares today", "author": "Sharp-Direction-6894", "score": 176, "comments": [{"author": "Various_Cabinet_5071", "created": 1716941797.0, "text": "The real world consequences of ChatGPT messing up is not nearly as dire.

Folks thought nuclear power would help us in so many ways, it seemed like a magic solution to humanities problems. However, with maturity the full picture of nuclear power limitations, hazards, operating costs, and scale have majorly pulled those expectations back. Nuclear science has done amazing things for research, medicine, energy generation, and other things, but it doesn't get us to the stars, and we still have coal, oil, and gas power stations, and the cost of generation of power is still high.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm not saying AI won't be important, useful, open up opportunities, but I think it's worth while tempering expectations. So far 2024 has seen a rather slow progress, we have iterative improvements, but nothing like gpt3 to GPT4, as yet.\u00a0\n\n\nI think there is a reasonable argument for LLMs having some hard problems with confidence. We can keep making more elaborate token predictions, and fine tuned models, and indeed experiment with agents that compose a pseudo brain-like self observing reason engine. However, LLMs don't understand anything, they predict tokens in extremely complex ways that simulate understanding. As such we seem to be left with having to fine tune a McDonald's ordering system to explicitly curb errors like \"ordering 200 ketchups\" doesn't make sense. But when you do that, how do you deal with the stoner who wants 200 ketchups? Just with self driving cars, we will need human agents to intervene when an LLM hits these situations.\u00a0\n\n\nSo yeah, maybe we have AI ordering systems, but I expect they will be monitored and assisted by humans. Quite the role reversal. I can see how McDonald's will reduce their workforce like that.\u00a0\n\n\nI think the future is unpredictable.

You are yelling at me for saying that there may be only a 5% build out as opposed to thinking that companies are almost fully built out in their accelerated compute needs.

How do you think this stock is climbing to the heavens? \n\nI think you misunderstand why I posted the video. This entire thing. This entire GPU extravaganza is predicated on Open AI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and the rest of the world X China finds incredible gains in the advancement of AI. \n\nThere is literally an AI industrial revolution happening before our eyes and Nvidia is at the head of it. The previous industrial revolution spanned from about 1760 - 1840. That's 80 years. \n\nTo think that after year 2ish/3ish of in earnest Open AI GPT3,3.5,4,4o that it is some crazy off the wall statement to assume that companies are more towards a 5% build out of accelerated compute is puzzling to me at best. \n\nMoreover, the chip constraint due to manufacturing capacity is another obvious sign that TSM and Intel are working hard to address. It's more likely that we are at the beginning stages rather than the middle and or end. Maybe it's 10% - 15% for some, 2% for others and 75% for startups. Who knows. Overall, I am simply saying that Jensen made the point to say that during the call and I think it was insightful. Amazon is planning on 100 Billion, Microsoft 150 Billion, Google, X/Tesla and Nvidia JUST started shipping H200's. \n\nIf you want that stock at $1500 and not a crash happening on a future quarter you'd better hope that we are in the very early innings and that Open AI continues to shock and awe the industry. \n\nLastly, I think in earnest, we are more at the 5% than not and this is mostly because of time.

AI compute used for training today is substantial, but less than 50% and will keep declining as a percentage.   \n\nTime is required to validate and research different SOTA models using this approach (there's a lot more than just LLMs), develop hardware, adopt the approach, and develop an ecosystem. \n\nIMO\n\n1. This paper is exciting because it brings us closer to having powerful edge AI solutions (e.g. robots, autonomous vehicles, AI on personal devices) where power and compute are both at a premium and usage is almost all inference. APPL and MSFT should be interested.\n\n2. Using arithmetic with ternary values is a simple operation compared to floating point. It's unclear that Nvidia would be able to maintain a moat for inference. \n\n3. If approaches like this pan out, it would most likely take years before impacting NVDA at the datacenter. However, the impact could be much sooner for edge AI. \n\nSource: Claude 3.5 and GPT 4o discussing this paper with me moderating. Here's the tail end of a lengthy discussion where their conclusions agree that the FP reduction could be around 30% for training and 90% for inference. No one really knows for sure though, without more independent research.  \n\n------------\n\nChat GPT 4o concurs with Claude 3.5 on 90% reduction in FP operations for inference.\n\nGPT 4o summarizing both views for training: \n\nWhile the MatMul-free approach provides substantial efficiency gains, particularly in reducing the computational complexity of the forward pass, the overall training process still requires significant FP operations, especially during the backward pass. Therefore, a more conservative estimate of around 25-30% reduction in FP operations during the entire training process is more realistic.\n\nThis balanced view acknowledges the significant contributions of the paper while maintaining a realistic perspective on the extent of FP operation reductions in training.\n\nClause 3.5 Sonnet on Nvida moat for this approach: \n\nThis approach is indeed different enough that CUDA, in its current form, would not provide as strong a moat for inference chips specifically designed for this ternary arithmetic approach. The fundamental differences in computation could create an opening for competitors to develop new, highly optimized solutions without the need to compete directly with CUDA's strengths.\n\nHowever, several factors mitigate this risk for NVIDIA:\n\n1. NVIDIA's resources and expertise could allow them to quickly adapt and develop optimized solutions for this new approach.\n2. The broader AI ecosystem, including training and other non-ternary models, would still benefit from CUDA.\n3. NVIDIA's overall hardware expertise and manufacturing capabilities remain significant advantages.\n\nIn summary, while this approach could reduce CUDA's effectiveness as a moat specifically for ternary-based inference chips, NVIDIA's overall position in the AI hardware market would likely remain strong due to their ability to adapt, their broader ecosystem, and their hardware expertise. The impact would be more pronounced if this approach becomes dominant in both training and inference across a wide range of AI applications."}], "created": 1719419553.0}, {"title": "\u2705 Daily Chat Thread and Discussion \u2705", "author": "AutoModerator", "score": 22, "comments": [{"author": "67856788899", "created": 1719303595.0, "text": "Wake up babe!, Nvidia is going up!"}], "created": 1719201649.0}, {"title": "Is it time to go full regards again?

For example I do think BTC market cap will exceed Gold in the next 5-10 years, can NVDA do that? If so that's a 5x from here (or more if Gold goes up in the meantime). I want to hear someone explain why it will be and give me info to do my own research and if it makes sense to me I add an amount to my portfolio commensurate to my level of confidence after reviewing everything, or if I cannot justify it at this price I'll sit out. I really wish I invested when I first saw it, but I don't wanna be the guy who just buys at the top due to FOMO and watches it sink back down or float around for no meaningful result. The other thing I keep thinking about is that I knew about BTC and sat out for many years before finally taking the plunge in 2022, if I bought in when I first heard of it I'd be a multi millionaire now, I've made money on that position anyway, but nowhere near what it could be as I knew about it when it was a few hundred dollars a coin.
